v</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>A further edition of this book&mdash;the sixteenth&mdash;having been
called for, I have been asked by the publishers to furnish a preface to
it.&nbsp; For prefaces I have no love.&nbsp; Books should speak for
themselves.&nbsp; Prefaces can scarcely be otherwise than egotistic, and
one would not willingly add to the too numerous illustrations of this
tendency with which the literature of the day abounds.&nbsp; I would much
rather leave the volume with the simple &ldquo;Envoy&rdquo; which I wrote
for it when the Bon Gaultier Ballads were first gathered into a
volume.&nbsp; There the products of the dual authorship of Aytoun and
myself were ascribed to the Bon Gaultier under whose editorial auspices
they had for the most part seen the light.&nbsp; But my publishers tell me
<!-- page vi--><a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>that
people want to know why, and how, and by which of us these poems were
written,&mdash;curiosity, complimentary, no doubt, but which it is by no
means easy for the surviving bard to satisfy.&nbsp; It is sixty years since
most of these verses were written with the light heart and fluent pen of
youth, and with no thought of their surviving beyond the natural life of
ephemeral magazine pieces of humour.&nbsp; After a long and very crowded
life, of which literature has occupied the smallest part, it is difficult
for me to live back into the circumstances and conditions under which they
were written, or to mark, except to a very limited extent, how far to
Aytoun, and how far to myself, separately, the contents of the volume are
to be assigned.&nbsp; I found this difficult when I wrote Aytoun&rsquo;s
Life in 1867, and it is necessarily a matter of greater difficulty now in
1903.</p>
<p>I can but endeavour to show how Aytoun and I came together, and how for
two or three years we worked together in literature.&nbsp; Aytoun (born
21st June 1813) was three years older than myself, and he was known already
as a writer in &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo;s Magazine&rsquo; when I made his
acquaintance in 1841.&nbsp; For <!-- page vii--><a name="pagevii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. vii</span>some years I had been writing in Tait&rsquo;s
and Fraser&rsquo;s Magazines, and elsewhere, articles and verses, chiefly
humorous, both in prose and verse, under the <i>nom de guerre</i> of Bon
Gaultier.&nbsp; This name, which seemed a good one for the author of
playful and occasionally satirical papers, had caught my fancy in Rabelais,
<a name="citationvii"></a><a href="#footnotevii" class="citation">[vii]</a>
where he says of himself, &ldquo;A moy n&rsquo;est que honneur et gloire
d&rsquo;estre diet et reput&eacute; Bon Gaultier et bon Compaignon; en ce
nom, suis bien venue en toutes bonnes compaignees de
Pantagruelistes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was to one of these papers that I owed my introduction to
Aytoun.&nbsp; What its nature was may be inferred from its
title&mdash;&ldquo;Flowers of Hemp; or, The Newgate Garland.&nbsp; By One
of the Family.&rdquo;&nbsp; Like most of the papers on which we
subsequently worked together, the object was not merely to amuse, but also
to strike at some prevailing literary craze or vitiation of taste.&nbsp; I
have lived to see many such crazes since.&nbsp; Every decade seems to
produce one.&nbsp; But the particular craze against which this paper was
directed was the popularity of novels and songs, of which the ruffians <!--
page viii--><a name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. viii</span>of
the Newgate Calendar were the accepted heroes.&nbsp; If my memory does not
deceive me, it began with Harrison Ainsworth&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Rookwood,&rsquo; in which the gallantries of Dick Turpin, and the
brilliant description of his famous Ride to York, caught the public
fancy.&nbsp; Encouraged by the success of this book, Ainsworth next wooed
the sympathies of the public for Jack Sheppard and his associates in his
novel of that name.&nbsp; The novel was turned into a melodrama, in which
Mrs Keeley&rsquo;s clever embodiment of that &ldquo;marvellous boy&rdquo;
made for months and months the fortunes of the Adelphi Theatre; while the
sonorous musical voice of Paul Bedford as Blueskin in the same play brought
into vogue a song with the refrain,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Nix my dolly, pals, fake away!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which travelled everywhere, and made the patter of thieves and burglars
&ldquo;familiar in our mouths as household words.&rdquo;&nbsp; It deafened
us in the streets, where it was as popular with the organ-grinders and
German bands as Sullivan&rsquo;s brightest melodies ever were in a later
day.&nbsp; It clanged at midday from the <!-- page ix--><a
name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p. ix</span>steeple of St Giles,
the Edinburgh cathedral; <a name="citationix"></a><a href="#footnoteix"
class="citation">[ix]</a> it was whistled by every dirty
&ldquo;gutter-snipe,&rdquo; and chanted in drawing-rooms by fair lips,
that, little knowing the meaning of the words they sang, proclaimed to
their admiring friends&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In a box of the stone jug I was born,<br />
Of a hempen widow the kid forlorn;<br />
My noble father, as I&rsquo;ve heard say,<br />
Was a famous marchant of capers gay;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ending with the inevitable and insufferable chorus,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Nix my dolly, pals, fake away!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Soon after the Newgate Calendar was appealed to for a hero by the author
of &lsquo;Pelham,&rsquo; who had already won no small distinction, and who
in his &lsquo;Paul Clifford&rsquo; did his best to throw a halo of romance
around the highwayman&rsquo;s career.&nbsp; Not satisfied with this, Bulwer
next claimed the sympathies of his readers for Eugene Aram, and exalted a
very common type of murderer into a nobly minded and highly sentimental
scholar.&nbsp; Crime and criminals became the favourite theme of a <!--
page x--><a name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p. x</span>multitude of
novelists of a lower class.&nbsp; They even formed the central interest of
the &lsquo;Oliver Twist&rsquo; of Charles Dickens, whose Fagin and his
pupil &ldquo;the Artful Dodger,&rdquo; Bill Sykes and Nancy, were
simultaneously presented to us in their habits as they lived by the genius
of George Cruikshank, with a power that gave a double interest to
Dickens&rsquo;s masterly delineation of these worthies.</p>
<p>The time seemed&mdash;in 1841&mdash;to have come to open people&rsquo;s
eyes to the dangerous and degrading taste of the hour, and it struck me
that this might be done by pushing to still further extravagance the
praises which had been lavishly bestowed upon the gentlemen whose career
generally terminated in Newgate or on the Tyburn Tree, and by giving
&ldquo;the accomplishment of verse&rdquo; to the sentiments and the
language which formed the staple of the popular thieves&rsquo; literature
of the circulating libraries.&nbsp; The medium chosen was the review of a
manuscript, supposed to be sent to the writer by a man who had lived so
fully up to his own convictions as to the noble vocation of those who set
law at defiance, and lived by picking pockets, burglary, and highway
robbery, <!-- page xi--><a name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xi</span>diversified by an occasional murder, that, with the finisher of
the law&rsquo;s assistance, he had ended his exploits in what the slang of
his class called &ldquo;a breakfast of hartichoke with caper
sauce.&rdquo;&nbsp; How hateful the phrase!&nbsp; But it was one of many
such popularly current in those days.</p>
<p>The author of my &ldquo;Thieves&rsquo; Anthology&rdquo; was described in
my paper as a well-born man of good education, who, having ruined himself
by his bad habits, had fallen into the criminal ranks, but had not
forgotten the <i>liter&aelig; humaniores</i> which he had learned at the
Heidelberg University.&nbsp; Of the purpose with which he had written he
spoke thus in what I described as the fragments of a preface to his
Miscellany:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;To rescue from oblivion the martyrs of independence, to throw
around the mighty names that flash upon us from the squalor of the
Chronicles of Newgate the radiance of a storied imagination, to clothe the
gibbet and the hulks &lsquo;in golden exhalations of the dawn,&rsquo; and
secure for the boozing-ken and the gin-palace that hold upon the general
sympathies which has too long been monopolised by the cottage and the
drawing-room, has been the aim and the achievement of many recent authors
of <!-- page xii--><a name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xii</span>distinction.&nbsp; How they have succeeded, let the populous
state of the public jails attest.&nbsp; The office of &lsquo;dubsman&rsquo;
[hangman] has ceased to be a sinecure, and the public and Mr Joseph Hume
have the satisfaction of knowing that these useful functionaries have now
got something to do for their salaries.&nbsp; The number of their pupils
has increased, is increasing, and is not likely to be diminished.&nbsp; But
much remains to be done.&nbsp; Many an untenanted cell still echoes only to
the sighs of its own loneliness.&nbsp; New jails are rising around us,
which require to be filled.&nbsp; The Penitentiary presently erecting at
Perth is of the most commodious description.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this state of things I have bethought myself of throwing, in
the words of Goethe, &lsquo;my corn into the great seed-field of
time,&rsquo; in the hope that it may blossom to purposes of great public
utility.&nbsp; The aid of poetry has hitherto been but partially employed
in the spread of a taste for Conveyancing, especially in its higher
branches.&nbsp; Or where the Muse has shown herself, it has been but in the
evanescent glimpses of a song.&nbsp; She has plumed her wings for no
sustained flight. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;The power of poetry over the heart and impulses of man has been
recognised by all writers from Aristotle down to Serjeant Talfourd.&nbsp;
In dexterous hands it has been known to subvert a severe chastity by the
insinuations of a holy flame, to clothe impurity in vestments &lsquo;bright
with something <!-- page xiii--><a name="pagexiii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xiii</span>of an angel light,&rsquo; to exalt spleen
into elevation of soul, and selfishness into a noble scorn of the world,
and, with the ringing cadences of an enthusiastic style, to ennoble the
vulgar and to sanctify the low.&nbsp; How much may be done, with an engine
of such power, in increasing the numbers of &lsquo;The Family&rsquo; may be
conceived.&nbsp; The Muse of Faking, fair daughter of the herald Mercury,
claims her place among &lsquo;The Mystic Nine.&rsquo;&nbsp; Her language,
erewhile slumbering in the pages of the Flash Dictionary, now lives upon
the lips of all, even in the most fashionable circles.&nbsp; Ladies accost
crossing-sweepers as &lsquo;dubsmen&rsquo;; whist-players are generally
spoken of in gambling families as &lsquo;<i>dummy</i>-hunters&rsquo;;
children in their nursery sports are accustomed to &lsquo;nix their
dolls&rsquo;; and the all but universal summons to exertion of every
description is &lsquo;Fake away!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Words are things,&rsquo; says Apollonius of Tyana.&nbsp;
We cannot be long familiar with a symbol without becoming intimate with
that which it expresses.&nbsp; Let the public mind, then, be in the habit
of associating these and similar expressions with passages of poetical
power, let the ideas they import be imbedded in their hearts and glorified
in their imaginations, and the fairest results may with confidence be
anticipated.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In song and sonnet and ballad these views were illustrated and
enforced.&nbsp; They served <!-- page xiv--><a name="pagexiv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xiv</span>the purpose of the ridicule which it was hoped
might operate to cure people of the prevailing toleration for the romance
of the slums and the thieves&rsquo; kitchen.&nbsp; Naturally parody was
freely used.&nbsp; Wordsworth did not escape.&nbsp; His</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Milton, thou shouldst be living at this hour,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>found its echo in</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Turpin, thou shouldst be living at this hour,<br />
England hath need of thee,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And his &ldquo;Great men have been among us,&rdquo; &amp;c., was
perverted into</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Great men have been among us,&mdash;Names that lend<br />
&nbsp;  A lustre to our calling; better none;<br />
&nbsp;  Maclaine, Duval, Dick Turpin, Barrington,<br />
Blueskin and others, who called Sheppard friend.<br />
.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; .<br />
. . . Now, &rsquo;tis strange,<br />
We never see such souls as we had then;<br />
&nbsp;  Perpetual larcenies and such small change!<br />
No single cracksman paramount, no code,<br />
No master spirit, that will take the road,<br />
But equal dearth of pluck and highwaymen!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nor did even Shelley&rsquo;s magnificent sonnet &ldquo;Ozymandias&rdquo;
escape the profane hand of the burglar poet.&nbsp; He wrote,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- page xv--><a name="pagexv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xv</span>&ldquo;I met a cracksman coming down the Strand,<br />
&nbsp;  Who said, &lsquo;A huge Cathedral, piled of stone,<br />
Stands in a churchyard, near St Martin&rsquo;s Le Grand,<br />
&nbsp;  Where keeps Saint Paul his sacerdotal throne.<br />
A street runs by it to the northward.&nbsp; There<br />
For cab and bus is writ &lsquo;No Thoroughfare,&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;  The Mayor and Councilmen do so command.<br />
And in that street a shop, with many a box,<br />
&nbsp;  Upon whose sign these fateful words I scanned:<br />
&lsquo;My name is Chubb, who makes the Patent Locks;<br />
&nbsp;  Look on my works, ye burglars, and despair!&rsquo;<br />
Here made he pause, like one that sees a blight<br />
&nbsp;  Mar all his hopes, and sighed with drooping air,<br />
&lsquo;Our game is up, my covies, blow me tight!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The versatile genius of the poet was equally at home in the simpler
lyric region of the Haynes Bayley school.&nbsp; Taking for his model the
favourite drawing-room ballad of the period, &ldquo;She wore a wreath of
roses the night that first we met,&rdquo; he made a parody of its
rhythmical cadence the medium for presenting some leading incidents in the
career of a Circe of &ldquo;the boozing ken,&rdquo; as thus,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;She wore a rouge like roses the night that first we met;<br />
Her lovely mug was smiling o&rsquo;er mugs of heavy wet;<br />
Her red lips had the fulness, her voice the husky tone,<br />
That told her drink was of a kind where water was unknown.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page xvi--><a name="pagexvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xvi</span>Then after a few more glimpses of this charming creature in her
downward progress, the bard wound up with this characteristic close to her
public life,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I saw her but a moment, but methinks I see her now,<br />
As she dropped the judge a curtsey, and he made her a bow.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it would be out of place to dwell longer upon those reckless
imitations.&nbsp; The only poem which ultimately found a place in the Bon
Gaultier volume was &ldquo;The Death of Duval.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The paper was a success.&nbsp; Aytoun was taken by it, and sought an
introduction to me by our common friend Edward Forbes the eminent
Naturalist, then a leading spirit among the students of the Edinburgh
University, beloved and honoured by all who knew him.&nbsp; Aytoun&rsquo;s
name was familiar to me from his contributions to &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo;s
Magazine,&rsquo; and I was well pleased to make his acquaintance, which
rapidly grew into intimate friendship, as it could not fail to do with a
man of a nature so manly and genial, and so full of spontaneous humour, as
well as of marked literary ability.&nbsp; <!-- page xvii--><a
name="pagexvii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xvii</span>His fancy had been
caught by some of the things I had written in this and other papers under
the name of Bon Gaultier, and when I proposed to go on with articles in a
similar vein, he fell readily into the plan and agreed to assist in
it.&nbsp; Thus a kind of Beaumont and Fletcher partnership was formed,
which commenced in a series of humorous papers that were published in
Tait&rsquo;s and Fraser&rsquo;s Magazines during the years 1842, 1843, and
1844.&nbsp; In these papers appeared, with a few exceptions, the verses
which form the present volume.&nbsp; They were only a portion, but no doubt
the best portion, of a great number of poems and parodies which made the
chief attraction of papers under such headings as &ldquo;Puffs and
Poetry,&rdquo; &ldquo;My Wife&rsquo;s Album,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Poets of the
Day,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cracknels for Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the last of these the parody appeared under the name of &ldquo;The
Jilted Gent, by Theodore Smifzer,&rdquo; which, as &ldquo;The Lay of the
Lovelorn,&rdquo; has become perhaps the most popular of the series.&nbsp; I
remember well Aytoun bringing to me some ten or a dozen lines of admirable
parody of &ldquo;Locksley Hall.&rdquo;&nbsp; That poem had been published
about two years before, and was <!-- page xviii--><a
name="pagexviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xviii</span>at the time by no
means widely known, but was enthusiastically admired by both Aytoun and
myself.&nbsp; What these lines were I cannot now be sure, but certainly
they were some of the best in the poem.&nbsp; They were too good to appear
as a fragment in the paper I was engaged upon, and I set to work to mould
them into the form of a complete poem, in which it is now known.&nbsp; It
was introduced in the paper thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There is a peculiar atrocity in the circumstances which gave rise
to the following poem, that stirs even the Dead Sea of our
sensibilities.&nbsp; The lady appears to have carried on a furious
flirtation with the bard&mdash;a cousin of her own&mdash;which she,
naturally perhaps, but certainly cruelly, terminated by marrying an old
East Indian nabob, with a complexion like curry powder, innumerable lacs of
rupees, and a woful lack of liver.&nbsp; A refusal by one&rsquo;s cousin is
a domestic treason of the most ruthless kind; and, assuming the
author&rsquo;s statement to be substantially correct, we must say that the
lady&rsquo;s conduct was disgraceful.&nbsp; What her sensations must be on
reading the following passionate appeal we cannot of course divine; but if
one spark of feeling lingers in her bosom, she must, for four-and-twenty
hours at least, have little appetite for mulligatawny.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page xix--><a name="pagexix"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xix</span>The reviewer then quotes the poem down to the general
commination, ending with</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Cursed be the clerk and parson,&mdash;cursed be the whole
concern!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then resumes his commentary:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This sweeping system of anathema may be consonant to what the
philosophers call a high and imaginative mood of passion, but it is surely
as unjust as any fulminations that ever emanated from the Papal
Chair.&nbsp; No doubt Cousin Amy behaved shockingly; but why, on that
account, should the Bank of England, incorporated by Royal Charter, or the
most respectable practitioner who prepared the settlements, along with his
innocent clerk, be handed over to the uncovenanted mercies of the foul
fiend?&nbsp; No, no, Smifzer, this will never do!&nbsp; In a more manly
strain is what follows.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The remainder of the poem is then given, ending with,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Rest thee with thy yellow nabob, spider-hearted Cousin
Amy!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the critic resumes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo, Smifzer!&nbsp; This is the right sort of thing&mdash;no
wishy-washy snivelling about a wounded heart and all that kind of stuff,
but savage sarcasm, the lava of a volcanic spirit.&nbsp; In a fine
prophetic strain is <!-- page xx--><a name="pagexx"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xx</span>that vision of Amy&rsquo;s feelings as the
inebriated nawab stumbles hazily into the drawing-room, steaming fulsomely
of chilma!&nbsp; And that picture of the African jungle, with Smifzer <i>in
puris</i> mounted on a high-trotting giraffe, with his twelve dusky brides
around him,&mdash;Cruikshank alone could do it justice.&nbsp; But the
triumph of the poem is in the high-toned sentiment of civilisation and
moral duty, which, esteeming &lsquo;the grey barbarian&rsquo; lower than
the &lsquo;Christian cad,&rsquo;&mdash;and that is low enough in all
conscience,&mdash;tears the captivating delusions of freedom and polygamy
from the poet&rsquo;s eyes, even when his pulse is throbbing at the
wildest, and sends him from the shades of the palm and the orange tree to
the advertising columns of the &lsquo;Morning Post.&rsquo;&nbsp; This is
indeed a great poem, and we need only add that the reader will find
something like it in Mr Alfred Tennyson&rsquo;s &lsquo;Locksley
Hall.&rsquo;&nbsp; There has been pilfering somewhere; but Messieurs
Smifzer and Tennyson must settle it between them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How little did I dream, when writing this, that I should hear the parody
quoted through the years up till now almost as often as the original
poem!&nbsp; Smifzer was wiser than Tennyson, for he never spoiled the
effect of his poem by admitting, like Tennyson in his &ldquo;Locksley Hall,
Sixty Years After,&rdquo; that it <!-- page xxi--><a
name="pagexxi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxi</span>was a good thing that
&ldquo;spider-hearted&rdquo; Amy threw him over as she did.</p>
<p>Luckily for us, not a few poets were then living whose style and manner
of thought were sufficiently marked to make imitation easy, and
sufficiently popular for a parody of their characteristics to be readily
recognised.&nbsp; Lockhart&rsquo;s &ldquo;Spanish Ballads&rdquo; were as
familiar in the drawing-room as in the study.&nbsp; Macaulay&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Lays of Ancient Rome,&rdquo; and his two other fine ballads, were
still in the freshness of their fame.&nbsp; Tennyson and Mrs Browning were
opening up new veins.&nbsp; These, with Moore, Leigh Hunt, Uhland, and
others of minor note, lay ready to our hands, as Scott, Byron, Crabbe,
Coleridge, Moore, Wordsworth, and Southey had done to James and Horace
Smith in 1812, when writing the &ldquo;Rejected Addresses.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Never, probably, were verses thrown off with a keener sense of enjoyment,
and assuredly the poets parodied had no warmer admirers than
ourselves.&nbsp; Very pleasant were the hours when we met, and now Aytoun
and now myself would suggest the subjects for each successive article, and
the verses with which they were to be illustrated.&nbsp; Most commonly this
<!-- page xxii--><a name="pagexxii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxii</span>was done in our rambles to favourite spots in the suburbs of
&ldquo;our own romantic town,&rdquo; on Arthur Seat, or by the shores of
the Forth, and at other times as we sat together of an evening, when the
duties of the day were over, and joined in putting line after line together
until the poem was completed.&nbsp; In writing thus for our own amusement
we never dreamed that these &ldquo;nug&aelig; literari&aelig;&rdquo; would
live beyond the hour.&nbsp; It was, therefore, a pleasant surprise when we
found to what an extent they became popular, not only in England, but also
in America, which had come in for no small share of severe though
well-meant ridicule.&nbsp; In those days who could say what fate might have
awaited us had we visited the States, and Aytoun been known to be the
author of &ldquo;The Lay of Mr Colt&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Fight with the
Snapping Turtle,&rdquo; or myself as the chronicler of &ldquo;The Death of
Jabez Dollar&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Alabama Duel&rdquo;?&nbsp; As it was,
our transatlantic friends took a liberal revenge by instantly pirating the
volume, and selling it by thousands with a contemptuous disregard of
author&rsquo;s copyright.</p>
<p>For Aytoun the extravagances of melodrama <!-- page xxiii--><a
name="pagexxiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxiii</span>and the feats and
eccentricities of the arena at Astley&rsquo;s amphitheatre had always a
peculiar charm.&nbsp; &ldquo;The terrible Fitzball,&rdquo; the English
Dumas, in quantity, not quality, of melodrama, Gomersal, one of the chief
equestrians, and Widdicomb, the master of the ring at Astley&rsquo;s, were
three of his favourite heroes.&nbsp; Ducrow, manager of Astley&rsquo;s, the
most daring and graceful of equestrians, and the fair Miss Woolford, the
star of his troupe, had charms irresistible for all lovers of the
circus.&nbsp; In Aytoun&rsquo;s enthusiasm I fully shared.&nbsp; Mine found
expression in &ldquo;The Courtship of our Cid,&rdquo; Aytoun&rsquo;s in
&ldquo;Don Fernando Gomersalez,&rdquo; in which I recognise many of my own
lines, but of which the conception and the best part of the verses were
his.&nbsp; Years afterwards his delight in the glories of the ring broke
out in the following passage in a too-good-to-be-forgotten article in
&lsquo;Blackwood,&rsquo; which, to those who may never hope to see in any
circus anything so inspiring, so full of an imaginative glamour, may give
some idea of the nightly scenes in the halcyon days of
Astley&rsquo;s:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We delight to see, at never-failing Astley&rsquo;s, the revived
glories of British prowess&mdash;Wellington in <!-- page xxiv--><a
name="pagexxiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxiv</span>the midst of his
staff, smiling benignantly on the facetious pleasantries of a Fitzroy
Somerset&mdash;Sergeant M&rsquo;Craw of the Forty-Second delighting the
<i>&eacute;lite</i> of Brussels by the performance of the reel of
Tullochgorum at the Duchess of Richmond&rsquo;s ball&mdash;the charge of
the Scots Greys&mdash;the single-handed combat of Marshal Ney and the
infuriated Life-Guardsman Shaw&mdash;and the final retreat of Napoleon
amidst a volley of Roman candles and the flames of an arsenicated
Hougomont.&nbsp; Nor is our gratification less to discern, after the
subsiding of the showers of sawdust so gracefully scattered by that groom
in the doeskin integuments, the stately form of Widdicomb, cased in martial
apparel, advancing towards the centre of the ring, and
commanding&mdash;with imperious gesture, and some slight flagellation in
return for dubious compliment&mdash;the double-jointed clown to assist the
Signora Cavalcanti to her seat upon the celebrated Arabian.&nbsp; How
lovely looks the lady, as she vaults to her feet upon the breadth of the
yielding saddle!&nbsp; With what inimitable grace does she whirl these tiny
banners around her head, as winningly as a Titania performing the sword
exercise!&nbsp; How coyly does she dispose her garments and floating
drapery to hide the too-maddening symmetry of her limbs!&nbsp; Gods!&nbsp;
She is transformed all at once into an Amazon&mdash;the fawn-like timidity
of her first demeanour is gone.&nbsp; Bold and beautiful flushes her cheek
with animated crimson&mdash;her full voluptuous lip is more compressed and
firm&mdash;the deep passion <!-- page xxv--><a name="pagexxv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxv</span>of the huntress flashing in her lustrous
eyes!&nbsp; Widdicomb becomes excited&mdash;he moves with quicker step
around the periphery of his central circle&mdash;incessant is the smacking
of his whip&mdash;not this time directed against Mr Merriman, who at his
ease is enjoying a swim upon the sawdust&mdash;and lo! the grooms rush in,
six bars are elevated in a trice, and over them all bounds the volatile
Signora like a panther, nor pauses until with airy somersets she has passed
twice through the purgatory of the blazing hoop, and then, drooping and
exhausted, sinks like a Sabine into the arms of the Herculean master,
who&mdash;a second Romulus&mdash;bears away his lovely burden to the
stables, amid such a whirlwind of applause as Kemble might have been proud
to earn.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Astley&rsquo;s has long been levelled with the dust; it is many years
since Widdicomb, Gomersal, Ducrow, and the Woolford passed into the Silent
Land.&nbsp; May their memory be preserved for yet a few years to come in
the mirthful strains of two of their most ardent and grateful admirers!</p>
<p>Of the longer poems in this volume the following were exclusively
Aytoun&rsquo;s: &ldquo;The Broken Pitcher,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Massacre of
the Macpherson,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Rhyme of Sir Launcelot Bogle,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Little John and the Red Friar,&rdquo; &ldquo;A Midnight
Meditation,&rdquo; and that admirable imitation <!-- page xxvi--><a
name="pagexxvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxvi</span>of the Scottish
ballad, &ldquo;The Queen in France.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some of the shorter poems
were also his&mdash;&ldquo;The Lay of the Levite,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tarquin and
the Augur,&rdquo; &ldquo;La Mort d&rsquo;Arthur,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Husband&rsquo;s Petition,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Sonnet to
Britain.&rdquo;&nbsp; The rest were either wholly mine or produced by us
jointly.</p>
<p>After 1844 the Bon Gaultier co-operation ceased.&nbsp; My profession and
removal from Edinburgh to London left no leisure or opportunity for work of
that kind, and Aytoun became busy with the Professorship of Belles Lettres
in the University and with his work at the Bar and on
&lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo;s Magazine.&rsquo;&nbsp; We had also during the Bon
Gaultier period worked together in a series of translations of
Goethe&rsquo;s Poems and Ballads for &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo;s
Magazine,&rsquo; which, like the Bon Gaultier Ballads, were collected,
added to, and published in a volume a year or two afterwards.&nbsp; In 1845
I left Edinburgh for London, and only met Aytoun at intervals there or at
Homburg in the future years; but our friendship was kept alive by active
correspondence.&nbsp; Literature was naturally his vocation, and he wrote
much and well, with exemplary industry, enlivening his papers in <!-- page
xxvii--><a name="pagexxvii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxvii</span>&lsquo;Blackwood,&rsquo; till his death in August 1865, with
the same manly sense, the same playfulness of fancy and flow of spontaneous
humour, which made his society and his letters always delightful to his
friends.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Multis ille bonis flebilis occidit,<br />
Nulli flebilior quam mihi!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first edition of this book, now very rare, appeared in 1845.&nbsp;
It was illustrated by Alfred Henry Forrester (Alfred Crowquill).&nbsp; In
the subsequent editions drawings by Richard Doyle and John Leech, in a
kindred spirit of fanciful extravagance, were added, and helped materially
towards the attractions of the volume.&nbsp; Its popularity surpassed the
utmost expectations of the authors.&nbsp; To them not the least pleasant
feature of its success was that it was widely read both in the Navy and the
Army, and was nowhere more in demand than in the trenches before Sebastopol
in 1854.</p>

<h3>The Broken Pitcher.</h3>
<p>It was a Moorish maiden was sitting by a well,<br />
And what the maiden thought of, I cannot, cannot tell,<br />
When by there rode a valiant knight from the town of Oviedo&mdash;<br />
Alphonzo Guzman was he hight, the Count of Tololedo.</p>
<p><!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>&ldquo;Oh, maiden, Moorish maiden, why sit&rsquo;st thou by the
spring?<br />
Say, dost thou seek a lover, or any other thing?<br />
Why dost thou look upon me, with eyes so dark and wide,<br />
And wherefore doth the pitcher lie broken by thy side?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not seek a lover, thou Christian knight so gay,<br />
Because an article like that hath never come my way;<br />
And why I gaze upon you, I cannot, cannot tell,<br />
Except that in your iron hose you look uncommon swell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My pitcher it is broken, and this the reason is,&mdash;<br />
A shepherd came behind me, and tried to snatch a kiss;<br />
I would not stand his nonsense, so ne&rsquo;er a word I spoke,<br />
But scored him on the costard, and so the jug was broke.</p>
<p><!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>&ldquo;My uncle, the Alcayd&egrave;, he waits for me at home,<br />

I cannot bring him water&mdash;the pitcher is in pieces&mdash;<br />
And so I&rsquo;m sure to catch it, &rsquo;cos he wallops all his
nieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, maiden, Moorish maiden! wilt thou be ruled by me?<br />
Then wipe thine eyes and rosy lips, and give me kisses three;<br />
And I&rsquo;ll give thee my helmet, thou kind and courteous lady,<br />
To carry home the water to thy uncle, the Alcayd&egrave;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lighted down from off his steed&mdash;he tied him to a tree&mdash;<br
/>
He bent him to the maiden, and he took his kisses three;<br />
&ldquo;To wrong thee, sweet Zorayda, I swear would be a sin!&rdquo;<br />
And he knelt him at the fountain, and he dipped his helmet in.</p>

rose the Moorish maiden&mdash;behind the knight she steals,<br />
And caught Alphonzo Guzman in a twinkling by the heels:<br />
She tipped him in, and held him down beneath the bubbling water,&mdash;<br

&ldquo;Now, take thou that for venturing to kiss Al Hamet&rsquo;s

<p>A Christian maid is weeping in the town of Oviedo;<br />

within a dingy dungeon pined that brave and noble knight,<br />
For the Saracenic warriors well they knew and feared his might;<br />
Long he lay and long he languished on his dripping bed of stone,<br />
Till the cankered iron fetters ate their way into his bone.</p>
<p>On the twentieth day of August&mdash;&rsquo;twas the feast of false
Mahound&mdash;<br />
Came the Moorish population from the neighbouring cities round;<br />
There to hold their foul carousal, there to dance and there to sing,<br />
And to pay their yearly homage to Al-Widdicomb, <a name="citation8"></a><a

<p>First they wheeled their supple coursers, wheeled them at their utmost
speed,<br />

King,<br />

Valiant, doubtless, are thy warriors, and their beards are long and
hairy,<br />
And a thunderbolt in battle is each bristly janissary:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I cannot, O my sovereign, quite forget that fearful day,<br

When I saw the Christian army in its terrible array;<br />
When they charged across the footlights like a torrent down its bed,<br />

<p>&ldquo;Thou shalt see thy champion, Cadi! hither quick the captive
bring!&rdquo;<br />
Thus in wrath and deadly anger spoke Al-Widdicomb, the King:<br />
&ldquo;Paler than a maiden&rsquo;s forehead is the Christian&rsquo;s hue, I
ween,<br />
Since a year within the dungeons of Grenada he hath been!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they brought the Gomersalez, and they led the warrior in;<br />
Weak and wasted seemed his body, and his face was pale and thin;<br />
<!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>But
the ancient fire was burning, unsubdued, within his eye,<br />
And his step was proud and stately, and his look was stern and high.</p>
<p>Scarcely from tumultuous cheering could the galleried crowd refrain,<br

For they knew Don Gomersalez and his prowess in the plain;<br />
But they feared the grizzly despot and his myrmidons in steel,<br />
So their sympathy descended in the fruitage of Seville. <a

<p>&ldquo;Wherefore, monarch, hast thou brought me from the dungeon dark

<p>Then they carried down the armour from the garret where it lay,<br />
Oh! but it was red and rusty, and the plumes were shorn away:<br />
And they led out Bavieca from a foul and filthy van,<br />
For the conqueror had sold him to a Moorish dog&rsquo;s-meat man.</p>
<p>When the steed beheld his master, loud he whinnied loud and free,<br />
And, in token of subjection, knelt upon each broken knee;<br />
And a tear of walnut largeness to the warrior&rsquo;s eyelids rose,<br />
As he fondly picked a bean-straw from his coughing courser&rsquo;s
nose.</p>

Time it is, my trusty charger, both of us were sent to grass!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he seized his lance, and, vaulting, in the saddle sate upright;<br
/>
Marble seemed the noble courser, iron seemed the mail&egrave;d knight;<br
/>
And a cry of admiration burst from every Moorish lady.<br />
&ldquo;Five to four on Don Fernando!&rdquo; cried the sable-bearded
Cadi.</p>
<p>Warriors three from Alcantara burst into the listed space,<br />
Warriors three, all bred in battle, of the proud Alhambra race:<br />
<!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>Trumpets sounded, coursers bounded, and the foremost straight went
down,<br />
Tumbling, like a sack of turnips, right before the jeering Clown.</p>
<p>In the second chieftain galloped, and he bowed him to the King,<br />
And his saddle-girths were tightened by the Master of the Ring;<br />
Through three blazing hoops he bounded ere the desperate fight
began&mdash;<br />
Don Fernando! bear thee bravely!&mdash;&rsquo;tis the Moor Abdorrhaman!</p>
<p>Like a double streak of lightning, clashing in the sulphurous sky,<br />
Met the pair of hostile heroes, and they made the sawdust fly;<br />
And the Moslem spear so stiffly smote on Don Fernando&rsquo;s mail,<br />
That he reeled, as if in liquor, back to Bavieca&rsquo;s tail:</p>
<p><!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>But he caught the mace beside him, and he gripped it hard and
fast,<br />
And he swung it starkly upwards as the foeman bounded past;<br />
And the deadly stroke descended through the skull and through the brain,<br
/>
As ye may have seen a poker cleave a cocoa-nut in twain.</p>
<p>Sore astonished was the monarch, and the Moorish warriors all,<br />
Save the third bold chief, who tarried and beheld his brethren fall;<br />
And the Clown, in haste arising from the footstool where he sat,<br />
Notified the first appearance of the famous Acrobat;</p>
<p>Never on a single charger rides that stout and stalwart Moor,&mdash;<br

Five beneath his stride so stately bear him o&rsquo;er the trembling
floor;<br />
<!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>Five

And the outer and the inner feel the pressure of his toes. <a

<p>Never wore that chieftain armour; in a knot himself he ties,<br />
With his grizzly head appearing in the centre of his thighs,<br />
Till the petrified spectator asks, in paralysed alarm,<br />
Where may be the warrior&rsquo;s body,&mdash;which is leg, and which is
arm?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sound the charge!&rdquo;&nbsp; The coursers started; with a yell
and furious vault,<br />
High in air the Moorish champion cut a wondrous somersault;<br />
O&rsquo;er the head of Don Fernando like a tennis-ball he sprung,<br />
Caught him tightly by the girdle, and behind the crupper hung.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Then his dagger Don Fernando plucked from out its jewelled sheath,<br />
And he struck the Moor so fiercely, as he grappled him beneath,<br />
That the good Damascus weapon sank within the folds of fat,<br />
And as dead as Julius C&aelig;sar dropped the Gordian Acrobat.</p>
<p><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>Meanwhile fast the sun was sinking&mdash;it had sunk beneath the
sea,<br />
Ere Fernando Gomersalez smote the latter of the three;<br />
And Al-Widdicomb, the monarch, pointed, with a bitter smile,<br />
To the deeply-darkening canvas;&mdash;blacker grew it all the while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou hast slain my warriors, Spaniard! but thou hast not kept thy
time;<br />
Only two had sunk before thee ere I heard the curfew chime;<br />
Back thou goest to thy dungeon, and thou may&rsquo;st be wondrous glad,<br
/>
That thy head is on thy shoulders for thy work to-day, my lad!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore all thy boasted valour, Christian dog, of no avail
is!&rdquo;<br />
Dark as midnight grew the brow of Don Fernando Gomersalez:&mdash;<br />
<!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>Stiffly sate he in his saddle, grimly looked around the ring,<br

Laid his lance within the rest, and shook his gauntlet at the King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thou foul and faithless traitor! wouldst thou play me false
again?<br />
Welcome death and welcome torture, rather than the captive&rsquo;s
chain!<br />
But I give thee warning, caitiff!&nbsp; Look thou sharply to thine
eye&mdash;<br />
Unavenged, at least in harness, Gomersalez shall not die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus he spoke, and Bavieca like an arrow forward flew,<br />
Right and left the Moorish squadron wheeled to let the hero through;<br />
Brightly gleamed the lance of vengeance&mdash;fiercely sped the fatal
thrust&mdash;<br />
From his throne the Moorish monarch tumbled lifeless in the dust.</p>

&nbsp; Saw ye ever such a maid,<br />
With the feathers swaling o&rsquo;er her,<br />
&nbsp; And her spangled rich brocade?<br />
In her fairy hand a horsewhip,<br />
&nbsp; On her foot a buskin small,<br />
So she stepped, the stately damsel,<br />
&nbsp; Through the scarlet grooms and all.</p>
<p>And she beckoned for her courser,<br />
&nbsp; And they brought a milk-white mare;<br />
Proud, I ween, was that Arabian<br />
&nbsp; Such a gentle freight to bear:<br />
And the master moved to greet her,<br />
&nbsp; With a proud and stately walk;<br />
And, in reverential homage,<br />
&nbsp; Rubbed her soles with virgin chalk.</p>
<p><!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Quite forgot the maids beside them;<br />

When she raised two Roman candles,<br />
&nbsp; Shooting fireballs red and blue!</p>
<p>Swifter than the Tartar&rsquo;s arrow,<br />
&nbsp; Lighter than the lark in flight,<br />
On the left foot now she bounded,<br />
&nbsp; Now she stood upon the right.<br />
Like a beautiful Bacchante,<br />
&nbsp; Here she soars, and there she kneels,<br />
While amid her floating tresses<br />
&nbsp; Flash two whirling Catherine wheels!</p>

Saints protect thee, Woolfordinez,<br />
&nbsp; For his triumph sure is nigh!<br />
Now his courser&rsquo;s flanks he lashes,<br />
&nbsp; O&rsquo;er his shoulder flings the rein,<br />
And his feet aloft he tosses,<br />

<h3>The Fight with the Snapping Turtle;<br />
<i>or</i>,<br />

<h4>FYTTE FIRST.</h4>
<p>Have you heard of Philip Slingsby,<br />
&nbsp; Slingsby of the manly chest;<br />
How he slew the Snapping Turtle<br />
&nbsp; In the regions of the West?</p>
<p>Every day the huge Cawana<br />
&nbsp; Lifted up its monstrous jaws;<br />
And it swallowed Langton Bennett,<br />
&nbsp; And digested Rufus Dawes.</p>
<p><!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>Riled, I ween, was Philip Slingsby,<br />
&nbsp; Their untimely deaths to hear;<br />
For one author owed him money,<br />
&nbsp; And the other loved him dear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen now, sagacious Tyler,<br />
&nbsp; Whom the loafers all obey;<br />
What reward will Congress give me,<br />
&nbsp; If I take this pest away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then sagacious Tyler answered,<br />
&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the ring-tailed squealer!&nbsp; Less<br />
Than a hundred heavy dollars<br />
&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t be offered you, I guess!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a lot of wooden nutmegs<br />
&nbsp; In the bargain, too, we&rsquo;ll throw&mdash;<br />
Only you just fix the critter.<br />
&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you liquor ere you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Straightway leaped the valiant Slingsby<br />
&nbsp; Into armour of Seville,<br />
With a strong Arkansas toothpick<br />
&nbsp; Screwed in every joint of steel.</p>
<p><!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>&ldquo;Come thou with me, Cullen Bryant,<br />
&nbsp; Come with me, as squire, I pray;<br />
Be the Homer of the battle<br />
&nbsp; Which I go to wage to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they went along careering<br />
&nbsp; With a loud and martial tramp,<br />
Till they neared the Snapping Turtle<br />
&nbsp; In the dreary Swindle Swamp.</p>
<p>But when Slingsby saw the water,<br />
&nbsp; Somewhat pale, I ween, was he.<br />
&ldquo;If I come not back, dear Bryant,<br />
&nbsp; Tell the tale to Melanie!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell her that I died devoted,<br />
&nbsp; Victim to a noble task!<br />
Han&rsquo;t you got a drop of brandy<br />
&nbsp; In the bottom of your flask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, an alligator<br />
&nbsp; Swam across the sullen creek;<br />
And the two Columbians started,<br />
&nbsp; When they heard the monster shriek;</p>
<p><!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>For a snout of huge dimensions<br />
&nbsp; Rose above the waters high,<br />
And took down the alligator,<br />
&nbsp; As a trout takes down a fly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tarnal death! the Snapping Turtle!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp; Thus the squire in terror cried;<br />
But the noble Slingsby straightway<br />
&nbsp; Drew the toothpick from his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fare thee well!&rdquo; he cried, and dashing<br />
&nbsp; Through the waters, strongly swam:<br />
Meanwhile, Cullen Bryant, watching,<br />
&nbsp; Breathed a prayer and sucked a dram.</p>
<p>Sudden from the slimy bottom<br />
&nbsp; Was the snout again upreared,<br />
With a snap as loud as thunder,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp; And the Slingsby disappeared.</p>
<p>Like a mighty steam-ship foundering,<br />
&nbsp; Down the monstrous vision sank;<br />
And the ripple, slowly rolling,<br />
&nbsp; Plashed and played upon the bank.</p>
<p><!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>Still and stiller grew the water,<br />
&nbsp; Hushed the canes within the brake;<br />
There was but a kind of coughing<br />
&nbsp; At the bottom of the lake.</p>
<p>Bryant wept as loud and deeply<br />
&nbsp; As a father for a son&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a finished &rsquo;coon, is Slingsby,<br />
&nbsp; And the brandy&rsquo;s nearly done!&rdquo;</p>
<h4>FYTTE SECOND.</h4>
<p>In a trance of sickening anguish,<br />
&nbsp; Cold and stiff, and sore and damp,<br />
For two days did Bryant linger<br />
&nbsp; By the dreary Swindle Swamp;</p>
<p>Always peering at the water,<br />
&nbsp; Always waiting for the hour<br />
When those monstrous jaws should open<br />
&nbsp; As he saw them ope before.</p>
<p><!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>Still in vain;&mdash;the alligators<br />
&nbsp; Scrambled through the marshy brake,<br />
And the vampire leeches gaily<br />
&nbsp; Sucked the garfish in the lake.</p>
<p>But the Snapping Turtle never<br />
&nbsp; Rose for food or rose for rest,<br />
Since he lodged the steel deposit<br />

&nbsp; As the second moon arose,<br />
Gouging on the sloping greensward<br />
&nbsp; Some imaginary foes;</p>
<p>When the swamp began to tremble,<br />
&nbsp; And the canes to rustle fast,<br />
As though some stupendous body<br />

&nbsp; With such huge distended jaws,<br />
That they might have held Goliath<br />
&nbsp; Quite as well as Rufus Dawes.</p>
<p>Paws of elephantine thickness<br />
&nbsp; Dragged its body from the bay,<br />
And it glared at Cullen Bryant<br />
&nbsp; In a most unpleasant way.</p>
<p>Then it writhed as if in torture,<br />
&nbsp; And it staggered to and fro;<br />
And its very shell was shaken<br />
&nbsp; In the anguish of its throe:</p>
<p>And its cough grew loud and louder,<br />
&nbsp; And its sob more husky thick!<br />
For, indeed, it was apparent<br />
&nbsp; That the beast was very sick.</p>

45</span>The Lay of Mr Colt.</h3>
<p>[The story of Mr Colt, of which our Lay contains merely the sequel, is
this: A New York printer, of the name of Adams, had the effrontery to call
upon him one day for payment of an account, which the independent Colt
settled by cutting his creditor&rsquo;s head to fragments with an
axe.&nbsp; He then packed his body in a box, and sprinkling it with salt,
despatched it to a packet bound for New Orleans.&nbsp; Suspicions having
been excited, he was seized and tried before Judge Kent.&nbsp; The trial
is, perhaps, the most disgraceful upon the records of any country.&nbsp;
The ruffian&rsquo;s mistress was produced in court, and examined, in
disgusting detail, as to her connection with Colt, and his movements during
the days and nights succeeding the murder.&nbsp; The head of the murdered
man was bandied to and fro in the court, handed up to the jury, and
commented on by witnesses and counsel; and to crown the horrors of the
whole proceeding, the wretch&rsquo;s own counsel, a Mr Emmet, commencing
the defence with a cool admission that his client took the life of Adams,
and following it up by a detail of the whole circumstances of this most
brutal murder in the first person, as though he himself had been the
murderer, ended by telling the jury, that his client was &ldquo;<i>entitled
to the sympathy</i> of a jury of his country,&rdquo; as &ldquo;a young man
just entering into life, <i>whose prospects, probably, have been
permanently blasted</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Colt was found guilty; but a variety
of exceptions were taken to the charge by the judge, and after a long
series of appeals, which <i>occupied more than a year from the date of
conviction</i>, the sentence of death was ratified by Governor
Seward.&nbsp; The rest of Colt&rsquo;s story is told in our ballad.]</p>

I packed my quartered foeman up, and marked him &lsquo;prime

53</span>The Death of Jabez Dollar.</h3>
<p>[Before the following poem, which originally appeared in
&lsquo;Fraser&rsquo;s Magazine,&rsquo; could have reached America,
intelligence was received in this country of an affray in Congress, very
nearly the counterpart of that which the Author has here imagined in
jest.&nbsp; It was very clear, to any one who observed the then state of
public planners in America, that such occurrences must happen, sooner or
later.&nbsp; The Americans apparently felt the force of the satire, as the
poem was widely reprinted throughout the States.&nbsp; It subsequently
returned to this country, embodied in an American work on American manners,
where it characteristically appeared as the writer&rsquo;s own production;
and it afterwards went the round of British newspapers, as an amusing
satire, by an American, of his countrymen&rsquo;s foibles!]</p>
<p>The Congress met, the day was wet, Van Buren took the chair;<br />
On either side, the statesman pride of far Kentuck was there.<br />
With moody frown, there sat Calhoun, and slowly in his cheek<br />
His quid he thrust, and slaked the dust, as Webster rose to speak.</p>
<p>Upon that day, near gifted Clay, a youthful member sat,<br />
And like a free American upon the floor he spat;<br />
<!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>Then
turning round to Clay, he said, and wiped his manly chin,<br />
&ldquo;What kind of Locofoco&rsquo;s that, as wears the painter&rsquo;s
skin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; quoth Clay, &ldquo;avoid the way of Slick of
Tennessee;<br />
Of gougers fierce, the eyes that pierce, the fiercest gouger he;<br />
He chews and spits, as there he sits, and whittles at the chairs,<br />
And in his hand, for deadly strife, a bowie-knife he bears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Avoid that knife.&nbsp; In frequent strife its blade, so long and
thin,<br />
Has found itself a resting-place his rivals&rsquo; ribs within.&rdquo;<br
/>
But coward fear came never near young Jabez Dollar&rsquo;s heart,&mdash;<br
/>
&ldquo;Were he an alligator, I would rile him pretty smart!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>Then up he rose, and cleared his nose, and looked toward the
chair;<br />
He saw the stately stripes and stars,&mdash;our country&rsquo;s flag was
there!<br />
His heart beat high, with eldritch cry upon the floor he sprang,<br />
Then raised his wrist, and shook his fist, and spoke his first
harangue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who sold the nutmegs made of wood&mdash;the clocks that
wouldn&rsquo;t figure?<br />
Who grinned the bark off gum-trees dark&mdash;the everlasting nigger?<br />
For twenty cents, ye Congress gents, through &rsquo;tarnity I&rsquo;ll
kick<br />
That man, I guess, though nothing less than &rsquo;coonfaced Colonel
Slick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Colonel smiled&mdash;with frenzy wild,&mdash;his very beard waxed
blue,&mdash;<br />
His shirt it could not hold him, so wrathy riled he grew;<br />
<!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>He
foams and frets, his knife he whets upon his seat below&mdash;<br />
He sharpens it on either side, and whittles at his toe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! waken snakes, and walk your chalks!&rdquo; he cried, with ire
elate;<br />
&ldquo;Darn my old mother, but I will in wild cats whip my weight!<br />
Oh! &rsquo;tarnal death, I&rsquo;ll spoil your breath, young Dollar, and
your chaffing,&mdash;<br />
Look to your ribs, for here is that will tickle them without
laughing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His knife he raised&mdash;with fury crazed, he sprang across the
hall;<br />
He cut a caper in the air&mdash;he stood before them all:<br />
He never stopped to look or think if he the deed should do,<br />
But spinning sent the President, and on young Dollar flew.</p>
<p><!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>They met&mdash;they closed&mdash;they sank&mdash;they
rose,&mdash;in vain young Dollar strove&mdash;<br />
For, like a streak of lightning greased, the infuriate Colonel drove<br />
His bowie-blade deep in his side, and to the ground they rolled,<br />
And, drenched in gore, wheeled o&rsquo;er and o&rsquo;er, locked in each
other&rsquo;s hold.</p>
<p>With fury dumb&mdash;with nail and thumb&mdash;they struggled and they
thrust,<br />
The blood ran red from Dollar&rsquo;s side, like rain, upon the dust;<br />
He nerved his might for one last spring, and as he sank and died,<br />
Reft of an eye, his enemy fell groaning by his side.</p>
<p>Thus did he fall within the hall of Congress, that brave youth;<br />
The bowie-knife has quenched his life of valour and of truth;<br />
<!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>And
still among the statesmen throng at Washington they tell<br />
How nobly Dollar gouged his man&mdash;how gallantly he fell.</p>

<h3>The Alabama Duel.</h3>

Around he gazed, with legs upraised upon the bench before him;<br />
And, as he gave this sentence stern to him who stood beneath,<br />
Still with his gleaming bowie-knife he slowly picked his teeth.</p>
<p>It was high noon, the month was June, and sultry was the air,<br />
A cool gin-sling stood by his hand, his coat hung o&rsquo;er his chair;<br
/>
All naked were his manly arms, and shaded by his hat,<br />
Like an old senator of Rome that simple Archon sat.</p>
<p><!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>&ldquo;A bloody cheat?&mdash;Oh, legs and feet!&rdquo; in wrath
young Silas cried;<br />
And springing high into the air, he jerked his quid aside.<br />
&ldquo;No man shall put my dander up, or with my feelings trifle,<br />
As long as Silas Fixings wears a bowie-knife and rifle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your shoes pinch,&rdquo; replied Judge Lynch,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll very soon have ease;<br />
I&rsquo;ll give you satisfaction, squire, in any way you please;<br />
What are your weapons?&mdash;knife or gun?&mdash;at both I&rsquo;m pretty
spry!&rdquo;;<br />
&ldquo;Oh! &rsquo;tarnal death, you&rsquo;re spry, you are?&rdquo; quoth
Silas; &ldquo;so am I!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hard by the town a forest stands, dark with the shades of time,<br />
And they have sought that forest dark at morning&rsquo;s early prime;<br />

62</span>Lynch, backed by Nehemiah Dodge, and Silas with a friend,<br />
And half the town in glee came down to see that contest&rsquo;s end.</p>
<p>They led their men two miles apart, they measured out the ground;<br />
A belt of that vast wood it was, they notched the trees around;<br />
Into the tangled brake they turned them off, and neither knew<br />
Where he should seek his wagered foe, how get him into view.</p>
<p>With stealthy tread, and stooping head, from tree to tree they
passed,<br />
They crept beneath the crackling furze, they held their rifles fast:<br />
Hour passed on hour, the noonday sun smote fiercely down, but yet<br />
No sound to the expectant crowd proclaimed that they had met.</p>

<p>And now the sun was going down, when, hark! a rifle&rsquo;s crack!<br />
Hush&mdash;hush! another strikes the air, and all their breath draw
back,&mdash;<br />
Then crashing on through bush and briar, the crowd from either side<br />
Rush in to see whose rifle sure with blood the moss has dyed.</p>
<p>Weary with watching up and down, brave Lynch conceived a plan,<br />
An artful dodge whereby to take at unawares his man;<br />
<!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>He
hung his hat upon a bush, and hid himself hard by;<br />
Young Silas thought he had him fast, and at the hat let fly.</p>
<p>It fell; up sprang young Silas,&mdash;he hurled his gun away;<br />
Lynch fixed him with his rifle, from the ambush where he lay.<br />
The bullet pierced his manly breast&mdash;yet, valiant to the last,<br />
Young Fixings drew his bowie-knife, and up his foxtail <a

cast.</p>
<p>With tottering step and glazing eye he cleared the space between,<br />
And stabbed the air as stabs in grim Macbeth the younger Kean:<br />
Brave Lynch received him with a bang that stretched him on the ground,<br

Then sat himself serenely down till all the crowd drew round.</p>
<p><!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>They hailed him with triumphant cheers&mdash;in him each loafer
saw<br />
The bearing bold that could uphold the majesty of law;<br />
And, raising him aloft, they bore him homewards at his ease,&mdash;<br />
That noble judge, whose daring hand enforced his own decrees.</p>
<p>They buried Silas Fixings in the hollow where he fell,<br />
And gum-trees wave above his grave&mdash;that tree he loved so well;<br />
And the &rsquo;coons sit chattering o&rsquo;er him when the nights are long
and damp;<br />
But he sleeps well in that lonely dell, the Dreary &rsquo;Possum Swamp.</p>

66</span>The American&rsquo;s Apostrophe to Boz.</h3>
<p>[So rapidly does oblivion do its work nowadays that the burst of amiable
indignation with which America received the issue of his <i>American
Notes</i> and <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i> is now almost wholly
forgotten.&nbsp; Not content with waging a universal rivalry in the piracy
of the Notes, Columbia showered upon its author the riches of its own
choice vocabulary of abuse; while some of her more fiery spirits threw out
playful hints as to the propriety of gouging the &ldquo;stranger,&rdquo;
and furnishing him with a permanent suit of tar and feathers, in the then
very improbable event of his paying them a second visit.&nbsp; The perusal
of these animated expressions of free opinion suggested the following
lines, which those who remember Boz&rsquo;s book, and the festivities with
which he was all but hunted to death, will at once understand.&nbsp; The
object aimed at was to do justice to the bitterness and &ldquo;immortal
hate&rdquo; of these thin-skinned sons of freedom.&nbsp; Happily the storm
passed over: Dickens paid, in 1867-68, a second visit to the States, was
well received, made a not inconsiderable fortune by his Readings there, and
confessed that he had judged his American hosts harshly on his former
visit.]</p>

To thy parched and panting palate sweet as mother&rsquo;s milk they

Did the hams of old Virginny find no favour in thine eyes?<br />
Came no soft compunction o&rsquo;er thee at the thought of pumpkin pies?<br

Could not all our chicken fixings into silence fix thy scorn?<br />
Did not all our cakes rebuke thee,&mdash;Johnny, waffle, dander, corn?<br

Could not all our care and coddling teach thee how to draw it mild?<br />

No, my lad, a &rsquo;cuter vision than your own might soon have seen,<br />
That a true Columbian ogle carries little that is green;<br />
That we never will surrender useful privateering rights,<br />
Stoutly won at glorious Bunker&rsquo;s Hill, and other famous fights;<br />
That we keep our native dollars for our native scribbling gents,<br />

<h3>The Student of Jena.</h3>
<p>Once&mdash;&rsquo;twas when I lived at Jena&mdash;<br />
&nbsp; At a Wirthshaus&rsquo; door I sat;<br />
And in pensive contemplation<br />
&nbsp; Ate the sausage thick and fat;<br />
Ate the kraut that never sourer<br />
&nbsp; Tasted to my lips than here;<br />
Smoked my pipe of strong canaster,<br />
&nbsp; Sipped my fifteenth jug of beer;<br />
Gazed upon the glancing river,<br />
&nbsp; Gazed upon the tranquil pool,<br />
<!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>Whence the silver-voiced Undine,<br />
&nbsp; When the nights were calm and cool,<br />
As the Baron Fouqu&eacute; tells us,<br />
&nbsp; Rose from out her shelly grot,<br />
Casting glamour o&rsquo;er the waters,<br />
&nbsp; Witching that enchanted spot.<br />
From the shadow which the coppice<br />
&nbsp; Flings across the rippling stream,<br />
Did I hear a sound of music&mdash;<br />
&nbsp; Was it thought or was it dream?<br />
There, beside a pile of linen,<br />
&nbsp; Stretched along the daisied sward,<br />
Stood a young and blooming maiden&mdash;<br />
&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas her thrush-like song I heard.<br />
Evermore within the eddy<br />
&nbsp; Did she plunge the white chemise;<br />
And her robes were loosely gathered<br />
&nbsp; Rather far above her knees;<br />
Then my breath at once forsook me,<br />
&nbsp; For too surely did I deem<br />
That I saw the fair Undine<br />
&nbsp; Standing in the glancing stream&mdash;<br />
And I felt the charm of knighthood;<br />
&nbsp; <!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>And from that remembered day,<br />
Every evening to the Wirthshaus<br />
&nbsp; Took I my enchanted way.</p>
<p>Shortly to relate my story,<br />
&nbsp; Many a week of summer long<br />
Came I there, when beer-o&rsquo;ertaken,<br />
&nbsp; With my lute and with my song;<br />
Sang in mellow-toned soprano<br />
&nbsp; All my love and all my woe,<br />
Till the river-maiden answered,<br />
&nbsp; Lilting in the stream below:&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Fair Undine! sweet Undine!<br />
&nbsp; Dost thou love as I love thee?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Love is free as running water,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp; Was the answer made to me.</p>
<p>Thus, in interchange seraphic,<br />
&nbsp; Did I woo my phantom fay,<br />
Till the nights grew long and chilly,<br />
&nbsp; Short and shorter grew the day;<br />
Till at last&mdash;&rsquo;twas dark and gloomy,<br />
&nbsp; Dull and starless was the sky,<br />
<!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>And
my steps were all unsteady<br />
&nbsp; For a little flushed was I,&mdash;<br />
To the well-accustomed signal<br />
&nbsp; No response the maiden gave;<br />
But I heard the waters washing<br />
&nbsp; And the moaning of the wave.<br />
Vanished was my own Undine,<br />
&nbsp; All her linen, too, was gone;<br />
And I walked about lamenting<br />
&nbsp; On the river bank alone.<br />
Idiot that I was, for never<br />
&nbsp; Had I asked the maiden&rsquo;s name.<br />
Was it Lieschen&mdash;was it Gretchen?<br />
&nbsp; Had she tin, or whence she came?<br />
So I took my trusty meerschaum,<br />
&nbsp; And I took my lute likewise;<br />
Wandered forth in minstrel fashion,<br />
&nbsp; Underneath the louring skies:<br />
Sang before each comely Wirthshaus,<br />
&nbsp; Sang beside each purling stream,<br />
That same ditty which I chanted<br />
&nbsp; When Undine was my theme,<br />
Singing, as I sang at Jena,<br />
&nbsp; <!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>When the shifts were hung to dry,<br />
&ldquo;Fair Undine! young Undine!<br />
&nbsp; Dost thou love as well as I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, alas! in field or village,<br />
&nbsp; Or beside the pebbly shore,<br />
Did I see those glancing ankles,<br />
&nbsp; And the white robe never more;<br />
And no answer came to greet me,<br />
&nbsp; No sweet voice to mine replied;<br />
But I heard the waters rippling,<br />
&nbsp; And the moaning of the tide.</p>

<h3>The Lay of the Levite.</h3>
<p>There is a sound that&rsquo;s dear to me,<br />
&nbsp; It haunts me in my sleep;<br />
I wake, and, if I hear it not,<br />
&nbsp; I cannot choose but weep.<br />
Above the roaring of the wind,<br />
&nbsp; Above the river&rsquo;s flow,<br />
Methinks I hear the mystic cry<br />
&nbsp; Of &ldquo;Clo!&mdash;Old Clo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The exile&rsquo;s song, it thrills among<br />
&nbsp; The dwellings of the free,<br />
<!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>Its
sound is strange to English ears,<br />
&nbsp; But &rsquo;tis not strange to me;<br />
For it hath shook the tented field<br />
&nbsp; In ages long ago,<br />
And hosts have quailed before the cry<br />
&nbsp; Of &ldquo;Clo!&mdash;Old Clo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, lose it not! forsake it not!<br />
&nbsp; And let no time efface<br />
The memory of that solemn sound,<br />
&nbsp; The watchword of our race;<br />
For not by dark and eagle eye<br />
&nbsp; The Hebrew shall you know,<br />
So well as by the plaintive cry<br />
&nbsp; Of &ldquo;Clo!&mdash;Old Clo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even now, perchance, by Jordan&rsquo;s banks,<br />
&nbsp; Or Sidon&rsquo;s sunny walls,<br />
Where, dial-like, to portion time,<br />
&nbsp; The palm-tree&rsquo;s shadow falls,<br />
The pilgrims, wending on their way,<br />
&nbsp; Will linger as they go,<br />
And listen to the distant cry<br />
&nbsp; Of &ldquo;Clo!&mdash;Old Clo!&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Bursch Groggenburg.</h3>
<p>[<span class="smcap">after the manner of schiller</span>.]</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bursch! if foaming beer content ye,<br />
&nbsp; Come and drink your fill;<br />
In our cellars there is plenty;<br />
&nbsp; Himmel! how you swill!<br />
That the liquor hath allurance,<br />
&nbsp; Well I understand:<br />
But &rsquo;tis really past endurance,<br />
&nbsp; When you squeeze my hand!&rdquo;</p>

83</span>And he heard her as if dreaming,<br />
&nbsp; Heard her half in awe;<br />
And the meerschaum&rsquo;s smoke came streaming<br />
&nbsp; From his open jaw:<br />
And his pulse beat somewhat quicker<br />
&nbsp; Than it did before,<br />
And he finished off his liquor,<br />
&nbsp; Staggered through the door;</p>
<p>Bolted off direct to Munich,<br />
&nbsp; And within the year<br />
Underneath his German tunic<br />
&nbsp; Stowed whole butts of beer.<br />
And he drank like fifty fishes,<br />
&nbsp; Drank till all was blue;<br />
For he felt extremely vicious&mdash;<br />
&nbsp; Somewhat thirsty too.</p>
<p>But at length this dire deboshing<br />
&nbsp; Drew towards an end;<br />
Few of all his silver groschen<br />
&nbsp; Had he left to spend.<br />
<!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>And
he knew it was not prudent<br />
&nbsp; Longer to remain;<br />
So, with weary feet, the student<br />
&nbsp; Wended home again.</p>
<p>At the tavern&rsquo;s well-known portal<br />
&nbsp; Knocks he as before,<br />
And a waiter, rather mortal,<br />
&nbsp; Hiccups through the door&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Master&rsquo;s sleeping in the kitchen;<br />
&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll alarm the house;<br />
Yesterday the Jungfrau Fritchen<br />
&nbsp; Married baker Kraus!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like a fiery comet bristling,<br />
&nbsp; Rose the young man&rsquo;s hair,<br />
And, poor soul! he fell a-whistling<br />
&nbsp; Out of sheer despair.<br />
Down the gloomy street in silence,<br />
&nbsp; Savage-calm he goes;<br />
But he did no deed of vi&rsquo;lence&mdash;<br />
&nbsp; Only blew his nose.</p>
<p><!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>Then he hired an airy garret<br />
&nbsp; Near her dwelling-place;<br />
Grew a beard of fiercest carrot,<br />
&nbsp; Never washed his face;<br />
Sate all day beside the casement,<br />
&nbsp; Sate a dreary man;<br />
Found in smoking such an easement<br />
&nbsp; As the wretched can;</p>
<p>Stared for hours and hours together,<br />
&nbsp; Stared yet more and more;<br />
Till in fine and sunny weather,<br />
&nbsp; At the baker&rsquo;s door,<br />
Stood, in apron white and mealy,<br />
&nbsp; That belov&egrave;d dame,<br />
Counting out the loaves so freely,<br />
&nbsp; Selling of the same.</p>
<p>Then like a volcano puffing,<br />
&nbsp; Smoked he out his pipe;<br />
Sighed and supped on ducks and stuffing,<br />
&nbsp; Ham and kraut and tripe;<br />
<!-- page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>Went
to bed, and, in the morning,<br />
&nbsp; Waited as before,<br />
Still his eyes in anguish turning<br />
&nbsp; To the baker&rsquo;s door;</p>
<p>Till, with apron white and mealy,<br />
&nbsp; Came the lovely dame,<br />
Counting out the loaves so freely,<br />
&nbsp; Selling of the same.<br />
So one day&mdash;the fact&rsquo;s amazing!&mdash;<br />
&nbsp; On his post he died!<br />
And they found the body gazing<br />
&nbsp; At the baker&rsquo;s bride.</p>

All his previous debts compounded,<br />

And his father&rsquo;s feelings wounded<br />
&nbsp; With reflections on the same.</p>

<h3>The Knyghte and the Taylzeour&rsquo;s Daughter.</h3>
<p>Did you ever hear the story&mdash;<br />
&nbsp; Old the legend is, and true&mdash;<br />
How a knyghte of fame and glory<br />
&nbsp; All aside his armour threw;<br />
<!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>Spouted spear and pawned habergeon,<br />
&nbsp; Pledged his sword and surcoat gay,<br />
Sate down cross-legged on the shop-board,<br />
&nbsp; Sate and stitched the livelong day?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taylzeour! not one single shilling<br />
&nbsp; Does my breeches-pocket hold:<br />
I to pay am really willing,<br />
&nbsp; If I only had the gold.<br />
Farmers none can I encounter,<br />
&nbsp; Graziers there are none to kill;<br />
Therefore, prithee, gentle taylzeour,<br />
&nbsp; Bother not about thy bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Sir Knyghte, just once too often<br />
&nbsp; Have you tried that slippery trick;<br />
Hearts like mine you cannot soften,<br />
&nbsp; Vainly do you ask for tick.<br />
Christmas and its bills are coming,<br />
&nbsp; Soon will they be showering in;<br />
Therefore, once for all, my rum un,<br />
&nbsp; I expect you&rsquo;ll post the tin.</p>
<p><!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>&ldquo;Mark, Sir Knyghte, that gloomy bayliffe<br />
&nbsp; In the palmer&rsquo;s amice brown;<br />
He shall lead you unto jail, if<br />
&nbsp; Instantly you stump not down.&rdquo;<br />
Deeply swore the young crusader,<br />
&nbsp; But the taylzeour would not hear;<br />
And the gloomy, bearded bayliffe<br />
&nbsp; Evermore kept sneaking near.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither groat nor maravedi<br />
&nbsp; Have I got my soul to bless;<br />
And I&rsquo;d feel extremely seedy,<br />
&nbsp; Languishing in vile duresse.<br />
Therefore listen, ruthless taylzeour,<br />
&nbsp; Take my steed and armour free,<br />
Pawn them at thy Hebrew uncle&rsquo;s,<br />
&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ll work the rest for thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lightly leaped he on the shop-board,<br />
&nbsp; Lightly crooked his manly limb,<br />
Lightly drove the glancing needle<br />
&nbsp; Through the growing doublet&rsquo;s rim<br />
<!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>Gaberdines in countless number<br />
&nbsp; Did the taylzeour knyghte repair,<br />
And entirely on cucumber<br />
&nbsp; And on cabbage lived he there.</p>
<p>Once his weary task beguiling<br />
&nbsp; With a low and plaintive song,<br />
That good knyghte o&rsquo;er miles of broadcloth<br />
&nbsp; Drove the hissing goose along;<br />
From her lofty latticed window<br />
&nbsp; Looked the taylzeour&rsquo;s daughter down,<br />
And she instantly discovered<br />
&nbsp; That her heart was not her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Canst thou love me, gentle stranger?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp; Picking at a pink she stood&mdash;<br />
And the knyghte at once admitted<br />
&nbsp; That he rather thought he could.<br />
&ldquo;He who weds me shall have riches,<br />
&nbsp; Gold, and lands, and houses free.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;For a single pair of&mdash;<i>small-clothes</i>,<br />
&nbsp; I would roam the world with thee!&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>Then she flung him down the tickets<br />
&nbsp; Well the knyghte their import knew&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Take this gold, and win thy armour<br />
&nbsp; From the unbelieving Jew.<br />
Though in garments mean and lowly<br />
&nbsp; Thou wouldst roam the world with me,<br />
Only as a belted warrior,<br />
&nbsp; Stranger, will I wed with thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>At the feast of good Saint Stitchem,<br />
&nbsp; In the middle of the spring,<br />
There was some superior jousting,<br />
&nbsp; By the order of the King.<br />
&ldquo;Valiant knyghtes!&rdquo; proclaimed the monarch,<br />
&nbsp; &ldquo;You will please to understand,<br />
He who bears himself most bravely<br />
&nbsp; Shall obtain my daughter&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well and bravely did they bear them,<br />
&nbsp; Bravely battled, one and all;<br />
But the bravest in the tourney<br />
&nbsp; Was a warrior stout and tall.<br />
None could tell his name or lineage,<br />
&nbsp; None could meet him in the field,<br />
And a goose regardant proper<br />
&nbsp; Hissed along his azure shield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Warrior, thou hast won my daughter!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp; But the champion bowed his knee,<br />
&ldquo;Royal blood may not be wasted<br />
&nbsp; On a simple knyghte like me.<br />

&nbsp; But her heart is kind and free;<br />
Also, there is tin forthcoming,<br />
&nbsp; Though she is of low degree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly rose that nameless warrior,<br />
&nbsp; Slowly turned his steps aside,<br />
Passed the lattice where the princess<br />
&nbsp; Sate in beauty, sate in pride.<br />
Passed the row of noble ladies,<br />
&nbsp; Hied him to an humbler seat,<br />
And in silence laid the chaplet<br />
&nbsp; At the taylzeour&rsquo;s daughter&rsquo;s feet.</p>

<h3>The Midnight Visit.</h3>
<p>It was the Lord of Castlereagh, he sat within his room,<br />
His arms were crossed upon his breast, his face was marked with gloom;<br
/>
They said that St Helena&rsquo;s Isle had rendered up its charge,<br />
That France was bristling high in arms&mdash;the Emperor at large.</p>
<p><!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>&rsquo;Twas midnight! all the lamps were dim, and dull as death
the street,<br />
It might be that the watchman slept that night upon his beat,<br />
When lo! a heavy foot was heard to creak upon the stair,<br />
The door revolved upon its hinge&mdash;Great Heaven!&mdash;What enters
there?</p>
<p>A little man, of stately mien, with slow and solemn stride;<br />
His hands are crossed upon his back, his coat is opened wide;<br />
And on his vest of green he wears an eagle and a star,&mdash;<br />
Saint George! protect us! &rsquo;tis <span class="smcap">The
Man</span>,&mdash;the thunder-bolt of war!</p>
<p>Is that the famous hat that waved along Marengo&rsquo;s ridge?<br />
Are these the spurs of Austerlitz&mdash;the boots of Lodi&rsquo;s
bridge?<br />
<!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>Leads he the conscript swarm again from France&rsquo;s hornet
hive?<br />
What seeks the fell usurper here, in Britain, and alive?</p>
<p>Pale grew the Lord of Castlereagh, his tongue was parched and dry,<br />
As in his brain he felt the glare of that tremendous eye;<br />
What wonder if he shrank in fear, for who could meet the glance<br />
Of him who rear&rsquo;d, &rsquo;mid Russian snows, the gonfalon of
France?</p>
<p>From the side-pocket of his vest a pinch the despot took,<br />
Yet not a whit did he relax the sternness of his look:<br />
&ldquo;Thou thoughtst the lion was afar, but he hath burst the
chain&mdash;<br />
The watchword for to-night is France&mdash;the answer St Hel&eacute;ne.</p>
<p><!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>&ldquo;And didst thou deem the barren isle, or ocean waves, could
bind<br />
The master of the universe&mdash;the monarch of mankind?<br />
I tell thee, fool! the world itself is all too small for me;<br />
I laugh to scorn thy bolts and bars&mdash;I burst them, and am free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou thinkst that England hates me!&nbsp; Mark!&mdash;This very
night my name<br />
Was thundered in its capital with tumult and acclaim!<br />
They saw me, knew me, owned my power&mdash;Proud lord! I say, beware!<br />
There be men within the Surrey side, who know to do and dare!</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow in thy very teeth my standard will I rear&mdash;<br />
Ay, well that ashen cheek of thine may blanch and shrink with fear!<br />
<!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

And as I crossed the Borodin, so shall I cross the Thames!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou&rsquo;lt seize me, wilt thou, ere the dawn?&nbsp; Weak
lordling, do thy worst!<br />
These hands ere now have broke thy chains, thy fetters they have burst.<br
/>
Yet, wouldst thou know my resting-place?&nbsp; Behold, &rsquo;tis written
there!<br />
And let thy coward myrmidons approach me if they dare!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another pinch, another stride&mdash;he passes through the door&mdash;<br
/>
&ldquo;Was it a phantom or a man was standing on the floor?<br />
And could that be the Emperor that moved before my eyes?<br />
Ah, yes! too sure it was himself, for here the paper lies!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>With trembling hands Lord Castlereagh undid the mystic scroll,<br

With glassy eye essayed to read, for fear was on his soul&mdash;<br />

&nbsp; With his arm round Mary&rsquo;s waist.</p>
<p><!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>And his other hand is playing<br />
&nbsp; Most familiarly with hers;<br />
And I think my Brussels carpet<br />
&nbsp; Somewhat damaged by his spurs.<br />
&ldquo;Fire and furies! what the blazes?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp; Thus in frenzied wrath I call;<br />
When my spouse her arms upraises,<br />
&nbsp; With a most astounding squall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was there ever such a monster,<br />
&nbsp; Ever such a wretched wife?<br />
Ah! how long must I endure it,<br />
&nbsp; How protract this hateful life?<br />
All day long, quite unprotected,<br />
&nbsp; Does he leave his wife at home;<br />
And she cannot see her cousins,<br />
&nbsp; Even when they kindly come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the young Life-Guardsman, rising,<br />
&nbsp; Scarce vouchsafes a single word,<br />
But, with look of deadly menace,<br />
&nbsp; Claps his hand upon his sword;<br />
<!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>And in fear I faintly falter&mdash;<br />
&nbsp; &ldquo;This your cousin, then he&rsquo;s mine!<br />
Very glad, indeed, to see you,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you stop with us, and dine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Won&rsquo;t a ferret suck a rabbit?&mdash;<br />
&nbsp; As a thing of course he stops;<br />
And with most voracious swallow<br />
&nbsp; Walks into my mutton-chops.<br />
In the twinkling of a bed-post<br />
&nbsp; Is each savoury platter clear,<br />
And he shows uncommon science<br />
&nbsp; In his estimate of beer.</p>
<p>Half-and-half goes down before him,<br />
&nbsp; Gurgling from the pewter pot;<br />
And he moves a counter motion<br />
&nbsp; For a glass of something hot.<br />
Neither chops nor beer I grudge him,<br />
&nbsp; Nor a moderate share of goes;<br />
But I know not why he&rsquo;s always<br />
&nbsp; Treading upon Mary&rsquo;s toes.</p>
<p><!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>Evermore, when, home returning,<br />
&nbsp; From the counting-house I come,<br />
Do I find the young Life-Guardsman<br />
&nbsp; Smoking pipes and drinking rum.<br />
Evermore he stays to dinner,<br />
&nbsp; Evermore devours my meal;<br />
For I have a wholesome horror<br />
&nbsp; Both of powder and of steel.</p>
<p>Yet I know he&rsquo;s Mary&rsquo;s cousin,<br />
&nbsp; For my only son and heir<br />
Much resembles that young Guardsman,<br />
&nbsp; With the self-same curly hair;<br />
But I wish he would not always<br />
&nbsp; Spoil my carpet with his spurs;<br />
And I&rsquo;d rather see his fingers<br />
&nbsp; In the fire, than touching hers.</p>

<h3>The Queen in France.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">an ancient scottish ballad</span>.</p>
<h4>PART I.</h4>
<p>It fell upon the August month,<br />
&nbsp; When landsmen bide at hame,<br />
That our gude Queen went out to sail<br />
&nbsp; Upon the saut-sea faem.</p>
<p><!-- page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp; The like was never seen;<br />
And she has ta&rsquo;en the Prince Albert,<br />
&nbsp; And the bauld Lord Aberdeen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;se bide at hame, Lord Wellington:<br />
&nbsp; Ye daurna gang wi&rsquo; me:<br />
For ye hae been ance in the land o&rsquo; France,<br />
&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s eneuch for ye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;se bide at hame, Sir Robert Peel,<br />
&nbsp; To gather the red and the white monie;<br />
And see that my men dinna eat me up<br />
&nbsp; At Windsor wi&rsquo; their gluttonie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They hadna sailed a league, a league,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp; A league, but barely twa,<br />
When the lift grew dark, and the waves grew wan,<br />
&nbsp; And the wind began to blaw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O weel weel may the waters rise,<br />
&nbsp; In welcome o&rsquo; their Queen;<br />
What gars ye look sae white, Albert?<br />
&nbsp; What makes yer ee sae green?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp; Gie me a glass o&rsquo; the gude brandie:<br />
To set my foot on the braid green sward,<br />

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sweet to hunt the sprightly hare<br />
&nbsp; On the bonny slopes o&rsquo; Windsor lea,<br />
But oh, it&rsquo;s ill to bear the thud<br />
&nbsp; And pitching o&rsquo; the saut saut sea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And aye they sailed, and aye they sailed,<br />
&nbsp; Till England sank behind,<br />
And over to the coast of France<br />
&nbsp; They drave before the wind.</p>
<p>Then up and spak the King o&rsquo; France,<br />
&nbsp; Was birling at the wine;<br />
&ldquo;O wha may be the gay ladye,<br />
&nbsp; That owns that ship sae fine?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And wha may be that bonny lad,<br />

<p>&ldquo;And oh an it be England&rsquo;s Queen,<br />
&nbsp; She&rsquo;s welcome here the day;<br />
I&rsquo;d rather hae her for a friend<br />
&nbsp; Than for a deadly fae.</p>

&nbsp; The auld sow in the sty,<br />
And bake for her the brockit calf,<br />
&nbsp; But and the puddock-pie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he has gane until the ship,<br />
&nbsp; As soon as it drew near,<br />
And he has ta&rsquo;en her by the hand&mdash;<br />
&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re kindly welcome here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And syne he kissed her on ae cheek,<br />
&nbsp; And syne upon the ither;<br />
And he ca&rsquo;d her his sister dear,<br />

That she is free to come and gae<br />
&nbsp; Till twenty days are gane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lippened to a Frenchman&rsquo;s aith,&rdquo;<br />

155</span>[The six following Poems were among those forwarded to the Home
Secretary, by the unsuccessful competitors for the Laureateship, on its
becoming vacant by the death of Southey.&nbsp; How they came into our
possession is a matter between Sir James Graham and ourselves.&nbsp; The
result of the contest could never have been doubtful, least of all to the
great poet who then succeeded to the bays.&nbsp; His own sonnet on the
subject is full of the serene consciousness of superiority, which does not
even admit the idea of rivalry, far less of defeat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bays! which in former days have graced the brow<br />
&nbsp;  Of some, who lived and loved, and sang and died;<br />
&nbsp;  Leaves that were gathered on the pleasant side<br />
Of old Parnassus from Apollo&rsquo;s bough;<br />
With palpitating hand I take thee now,<br />
&nbsp;  Since worthier minstrel there is none beside,<br />
&nbsp;  And with a thrill of song half deified,<br />
I bind them proudly on my locks of snow.<br />
There shall they bide, till he who follows next,<br />
&nbsp;  Of whom I cannot even guess the name,<br />
Shall by Court favour, or some vain pretext<br />
&nbsp;  Of fancied merit, desecrate the same,&mdash;<br />
And think, perchance, he wears them quite as well<br />
As the sole bard who sang of Peter Bell!]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above note, which appeared in the first and subsequent editions of
this volume, is characteristic of the audacious spirit of fun in which Bon
Gaultier revelled.&nbsp; The sonnet here ascribed to Wordsworth must have
been believed by some matter-of-fact people to be really by him.&nbsp; On
his death in 1857, in an article on the subject of the vacant
Laureate-ship, it was quoted in a leading journal as proof of
Wordsworth&rsquo;s complacent estimate of his own supremacy over all
contemporary poets.&nbsp; In writing the sonnet I was well aware that there
was some foundation for his not unjust high appreciation of his own
prowess, as the phrase &ldquo;sole bard&rdquo; pretty clearly indicates,
but I never dreamt that any one would fail to see the joke.</p>

From Grub Street, and from Houndsditch, and from Farringdon Within,<br />
The poets all towards Whitehall poured on with eldritch din.</p>
<p>Loud yelled they for Sir James the Graham: <a name="citation157"></a><a

/>
A hardy knight were he that might face such a minstrelsie.<br />
&lsquo;Now by St Giles of Netherby, my patron Saint, I swear,<br />
I&rsquo;d rather by a thousand crowns Lord Palmerston were here!&mdash;</p>

you there beneath?&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;The bays, the bays! we want the bays! we seek the laureate
wreath!<br />
We seek the butt of generous wine that cheers the sons of song;<br />
Choose thou among us all, Sir Knight&mdash;we may not tarry
long!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Loud laughed the good Sir James in scorn&mdash;&lsquo;Rare jest it were,
I think,<br />
But one poor butt of Xeres, and a thousand rogues to drink!<br />
An&rsquo; if it flowed with wine or beer, &rsquo;tis easy to be seen,<br />
That dry within the hour would be the well of Hippocrene.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell me, if on Parnassus&rsquo; heights there grow a thousand
sheaves:<br />
Or has Apollo&rsquo;s laurel bush yet borne ten hundred leaves?<br />
<!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>Or
if so many leaves were there, how long would they sustain<br />
The ravage and the glutton bite of such a locust train?</p>
<p>&lsquo;No! get ye back into your dens, take counsel for the night,<br />
And choose me out two champions to meet in deadly fight;<br />
To-morrow&rsquo;s dawn shall see the lists marked out in Spitalfields,<br
/>
And he who wins shall have the bays, and he shall die who
yields!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Down went the window with a crash,&mdash;in silence and in fear<br />
Each ragg&egrave;d bard looked anxiously upon his neighbour near;<br />
Then up and spake young Tennyson&mdash;&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s here that fears
for death?<br />
&rsquo;Twere better one of us should die, than England lose the wreath!</p>

fight to-morrow;&mdash;<br />
For armour bright we&rsquo;ll club our mite, and horses we can borrow;<br

&rsquo;Twere shame that bards of France should sneer, and German
<i>Dichters</i> too,<br />
If none of British song might dare a deed of <i>derring-do</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The lists of Love are mine,&rsquo; said Moore, &lsquo;and not the

And monks shall sing, and bells shall ring, for him that goes to

<p>Eight hundred minstrels slunk away&mdash;two hundred stayed to

Now Heaven protect the daring wight that pulls the longest straw!<br />
&rsquo;Tis done! &rsquo;tis done!&nbsp; And who hath won?&nbsp; Keep

The first is William Wordsworth hight, the second Ned Fitzball!</p>
<h4>FYTTE THE SECOND.</h4>
<p>Oh, bright and gay hath dawned the day on lordly Spitalfields,&mdash;<br

How flash the rays with ardent blaze from polished helms and shields!<br />
On either side the chivalry of England throng the green,<br />
And in the middle balcony appears our gracious Queen.</p>
<p><!-- page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>With iron fists, to keep the lists, two valiant knights
appear,<br />
The Marquis Hal of Waterford, and stout Sir Aubrey Vere.<br />
&lsquo;What ho! there, herald, blow the trump!&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s see who
comes to claim<br />
The butt of golden Xeres, and the Laureate&rsquo;s honoured
name!&rsquo;</p>
<p>That instant dashed into the lists, all armed from head to heel,<br />
On courser brown, with vizor down, a warrior sheathed in steel;<br />
Then said our Queen&mdash;&lsquo;Was ever seen so stout a knight and
tall?<br />
His name&mdash;his race?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;An&rsquo;t please your grace,
it is the brave Fitzball. <a name="citation162"></a><a href="#footnote162"

<p>&lsquo;Oft in the Melodrama line his prowess hath been shown,<br />
And well throughout the Surrey side his thirst for blood is known.<br />
<!-- page 163--><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>But see, the other champion comes!&rsquo;&mdash;Then rang the
startled air<br />
With shouts of &lsquo;Wordsworth, Wordsworth, ho! the bard of Rydal&rsquo;s
there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And lo! upon a little steed, unmeet for such a course,<br />
Appeared the honoured veteran; but weak seemed man and horse.<br />
Then shook their ears the sapient peers,&mdash;&lsquo;That joust will soon
be done:<br />
My Lord of Brougham, I&rsquo;ll back Fitzball, and give you two to
one!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Done,&rsquo; quoth the Brougham,&mdash;&lsquo;And done with
you!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Now, Minstrels, are you ready?&rsquo;<br />
Exclaimed the Lord of Waterford,&mdash;&lsquo;You&rsquo;d better both sit
steady.<br />
Blow, trumpets, blow the note of charge! and forward to the
fight!&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;Amen!&rsquo; said good Sir Aubrey Vere; &lsquo;Saint Schism defend
the right!&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>As sweeps the blast against the mast when blows the furious
squall,<br />
So started at the trumpet&rsquo;s sound the terrible Fitzball;<br />
His lance he bore his breast before,&mdash;Saint George protect the
just!<br />
Or Wordsworth&rsquo;s hoary head must roll along the shameful dust!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who threw that calthrop?&nbsp; Seize the knave!&rsquo;&nbsp;
Alas! the deed is done;<br />
Down went the steed, and o&rsquo;er his head flew bright Apollo&rsquo;s
son.<br />
&lsquo;Undo his helmet! cut the lace! pour water on his head!&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;It ain&rsquo;t no use at all, my lord; &rsquo;cos vy? the
covey&rsquo;s dead!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Above him stood the Rydal bard&mdash;his face was full of woe.<br />
&lsquo;Now there thou liest, stiff and stark, who never feared a foe:<br />
<!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>A
braver knight, or more renowned in tourney and in hall,<br />
Ne&rsquo;er brought the upper gallery down than terrible
Fitzball!&rsquo;</p>
<p>They led our Wordsworth to the Queen&mdash;she crowned him with the
bays,<br />
And wished him many happy years, and many quarter-days;<br />
And if you&rsquo;d have the story told by abler lips than mine,<br />
You&rsquo;ve but to call at Rydal Mount, and taste the Laureate&rsquo;s
wine!&rdquo;</p>

<h3>The Royal Banquet.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">by the hon. g--- b--- s---</span>.</p>
<p>The Queen she kept high festival in Windsor&rsquo;s lordly hall,<br />
And round her sat the gartered knights, and ermined nobles all;<br />
There drank the valiant Wellington, there fed the wary Peel,<br />
And at the bottom of the board Prince Albert carved the veal.</p>
<p><!-- page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>&ldquo;What, pantler, ho! remove the cloth!&nbsp; Ho! cellarer,
the wine,<br />
And bid the royal nurse bring in the hope of Brunswick&rsquo;s
line!&rdquo;<br />
Then rose with one tumultuous shout the band of British peers,<br />
&ldquo;God bless her sacred Majesty!&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s see the little
dears!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now by Saint George, our patron saint, &rsquo;twas a touching sight to
see<br />
That iron warrior gently place the Princess on his knee;<br />
To hear him hush her infant fears, and teach her how to gape<br />
With rosy mouth expectant for the raisin and the grape!</p>
<p>They passed the wine, the sparkling wine&mdash;they filled the goblets
up;<br />
Even Brougham, the cynic anchorite, smiled blandly on the cup;<br />
<!-- page 168--><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>And Lyndhurst, with a noble thirst, that nothing could
appease,<br />
Proposed the immortal memory of King William on his knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What want we here, my gracious liege,&rdquo; cried gay Lord
Aberdeen,<br />
&ldquo;Save gladsome song and minstrelsy to flow our cups between?<br />
I ask not now for Goulburn&rsquo;s voice or Knatchbull&rsquo;s warbling
lay, <a name="citation168"></a><a href="#footnote168"
class="citation">[168]</a><br />
But where&rsquo;s the Poet Laureate to grace our board to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Loud laughed the Knight of Netherby, and scornfully he cried,<br />
&ldquo;Or art thou mad with wine, Lord Earl, or art thyself beside?<br />
Eight hundred Bedlam bards have claimed the Laureate&rsquo;s vacant
crown,<br />
And now like frantic Bacchanals run wild through London town!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>&ldquo;Now glory to our gracious Queen!&rdquo; a voice was heard
to cry,<br />
And dark Macaulay stood before them all with frenzied eye;<br />
&ldquo;Now glory to our gracious Queen, and all her glorious race,<br />
A boon, a boon, my sovran liege!&nbsp; Give me the Laureate&rsquo;s
place!</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas I that sang the might of Rome, the glories of
Navarre;<br />
And who could swell the fame so well of Britain&rsquo;s Isles afar?<br />
The hero of a hundred fights&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Then Wellington up
sprung,<br />
&ldquo;Ho, silence in the ranks, I say!&nbsp; Sit down and hold your
tongue!</p>
<p>&ldquo;By heaven, thou shalt not twist my name into a jingling lay,<br
/>
Or mimic in thy puny song the thunders of Assaye!<br />
&rsquo;Tis hard that for thy lust of place in peace we cannot dine.<br />
Nurse, take her Royal Highness, here!&nbsp; Sir Robert, pass the
wine!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>&ldquo;No Laureate need we at our board!&rdquo; then spoke the
Lord of Vaux;<br />
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s many a voice to charm the ear with minstrel song, I
know.<br />
Even I myself&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Then rose the cry&mdash;&ldquo;A song, a
song from Brougham!&rdquo;<br />
He sang,&mdash;and straightway found himself alone within the room.</p>

<p>Oh, weep for the hours, when the little blind boy<br />
&nbsp; Wove round me the spells of his Paphian bower;<br />
When I dipped my light wings in the nectar of joy,<br />
&nbsp; And soared in the sunshine, the moth of the hour!<br />
From beauty to beauty I passed, like the wind;<br />
&nbsp; Now fondled the lily, now toyed with the Rose;<br />
And the fair, that at morn had enchanted my mind,<br />
&nbsp; Was forsook for another ere evening&rsquo;s close.</p>
<p>I sighed not for honour, I cared not for fame,<br />
&nbsp; While Pleasure sat by me, and Love was my guest;<br />
They twined a fresh wreath for each day as it came,<br />
&nbsp; And the bosom of Beauty still pillowed my rest:<br />

&nbsp; In hall or by greenwood unheard were its songs;<br />
From Love&rsquo;s Sybarite dreams I aroused me, and swept<br />
&nbsp; Its chords to the tale of her glories and wrongs.</p>
<p>But weep for the hour!&mdash;Life&rsquo;s summer is past,<br />
&nbsp; And the snow of its winter lies cold on my brow;<br />
And my soul, as it shrinks from each stroke of the blast,<br />
&nbsp; Cannot turn to a fire that glows inwardly now.<br />
No, its ashes are dead&mdash;and, alas! Love or Song<br />
&nbsp; No charm to Life&rsquo;s lengthening shadows can lend,<br />
Like a cup of old wine, rich, mellow, and strong,<br />
&nbsp; And a seat by the fire <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with a

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Laureate bold,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With his butt of sherry<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To keep him merry,<br />
And nothing to do but to pocket his gold?<br />

When the days are hot, and the sun is strong,<br />
I&rsquo;d lounge in the gateway all the day long,<br />
With her Majesty&rsquo;s footmen in crimson and gold.<br />
I&rsquo;d care not a pin for the waiting-lord;<br />
But I&rsquo;d lie on my back on the smooth greensward<br />
With a straw in my mouth, and an open vest,<br />
And the cool wind blowing upon my breast,<br />
And I&rsquo;d vacantly stare at the clear blue sky,<br />
And watch the clouds that are listless as I,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lazily, lazily!<br />
And I&rsquo;d pick the moss and the daisies white,<br />
And chew their stalks with a nibbling bite;<br />
And I&rsquo;d let my fancies roam abroad<br />
In search of a hint for a birthday ode,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Crazily, crazily!</p>
<p>Oh, that would be the life for me,<br />
With plenty to get and nothing to do,<br />
But to deck a pet poodle with ribbons of blue,<br />
And whistle all day to the Queen&rsquo;s cockatoo,<br />

<!-- page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>Then the chambermaids, that clean the rooms,<br />
Would come to the windows and rest on their brooms,<br />
With their saucy caps and their crisp&egrave;d hair,<br />
And they&rsquo;d toss their heads in the fragrant air,<br />
And say to each other&mdash;&ldquo;Just look down there,<br />
At the nice young man, so tidy and small,<br />
Who is paid for writing on nothing at all,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Handsomely, handsomely!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They would pelt me with matches and sweet pastilles,<br />
And crumpled-up balls of the royal bills,<br />
Giggling and laughing, and screaming with fun,<br />
As they&rsquo;d see me start, with a leap and a run,<br />
From the broad of my back to the points of my toes,<br />
When a pellet of paper hit my nose,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Teasingly, sneezingly.<br />
Then I&rsquo;d fling them bunches of garden flowers,<br />
And hyacinths plucked from the Castle bowers;<br />
And I&rsquo;d challenge them all to come down to me,<br />
And I&rsquo;d kiss them all till they kiss&egrave;d me,<br />

Apart from care and apart from strife,<br />

Oh, that would be the post for me!<br />
With plenty to get and nothing to do,<br />
But to deck a pet poodle with ribbons of blue,<br />
And whistle a tune to the Queen&rsquo;s cockatoo,<br />
And scribble of verses remarkably few,<br />
And empty at evening a bottle or two,<br />

<p>Like one who, waking from a troublous dream,<br />

Calm as the sunlight sleeping on the hill;<br />
Calm as at Ephesus great Paul was seen<br />

Calm as the love that radiant Luther bore<br />
To all that lived behind him and before;<br />
Calm as meek Calvin, when, with holy smile,<br />
He sang the mass around Servetus&rsquo; pile,&mdash;<br />
So once again I snatch this harp of mine,<br />
To breathe rich incense from a mystic shrine.<br />

To pluck the laurel from its sacred bower;<br />
This brow alone is privileged to wear<br />
The ancient wreath o&rsquo;er hyacinthine hair;<br />
These lips alone may quaff the sparkling wine,<br />
<!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>And make its mortal juice once more divine.<br />
Back, ye profane!&nbsp; And thou, fair Queen, rejoice:<br />
A nation&rsquo;s praise shall consecrate thy choice.<br />
Thus, then, I kneel where Spenser knelt before,<br />
On the same spot, perchance, of Windsor&rsquo;s floor;<br />
And take, while awe-struck millions round me stand,<br />
The hallowed wreath from great Victoria&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<h3>Little John and the Red Friar.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">a lay of sherwood</span>.</p>
<h4>FYTTE THE FIRST.</h4>
<p>The deer may leap within the glade;<br />
&nbsp; The fawns may follow free&mdash;<br />
For Robin is dead, and his bones are laid<br />
&nbsp; Beneath the greenwood tree.</p>
<p><!-- page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>And broken are his merry, merry men,<br />
&nbsp; That goodly companie:<br />
There&rsquo;s some have ta&rsquo;en the northern road<br />
&nbsp; With Jem of Netherbee.</p>
<p>The best and bravest of the band<br />
&nbsp; With Derby Ned are gone;<br />
But Earlie Grey and Charlie Wood,<br />
&nbsp; They stayed with Little John.</p>
<p>Now Little John was an outlaw proud,<br />
&nbsp; A prouder ye never saw;<br />
Through Nottingham and Leicester shires<br />
&nbsp; He thought his word was law,<br />
And he strutted through the greenwood wide,<br />
&nbsp; Like a pestilent jackdaw.</p>
<p>He swore that none, but with leave of him,<br />
&nbsp; Should set foot on the turf so free:<br />
And he thought to spread his cutter&rsquo;s rule,<br />
&nbsp; All over the south countrie.<br />
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s never a knave in the land,&rdquo; he said,<br />
&nbsp; &ldquo;But shall pay his toll to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 188--><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>And Charlie Wood was a taxman good<br />
&nbsp; As ever stepped the ground,<br />
He levied mail, like a sturdy thief,<br />
&nbsp; From all the yeomen round.<br />
&ldquo;Nay, stand!&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;thou shalt pay to me<br />
&nbsp; Seven pence from every pound!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now word has come to Little John,<br />
&nbsp; As he lay upon the grass,<br />
That a Friar red was in merry Sherwood<br />
&nbsp; Without his leave to pass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come hither, come hither, my little foot-page!<br />
&nbsp; Ben Hawes, come tell to me,<br />
What manner of man is this burly frere<br />
&nbsp; Who walks the wood so free?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My master good!&rdquo; the little page said,<br />
&nbsp; &ldquo;His name I wot not well,<br />
But he wears on his head a hat so red,<br />
&nbsp; With a monstrous scallop-shell.</p>
<p><!-- page 189--><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>&ldquo;He says he is Prior of Copmanshurst,<br />
&nbsp; And Bishop of London town,<br />
And he comes with a rope from our father the Pope,<br />
&nbsp; To put the outlaws down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw him ride but yester-tide,<br />
&nbsp; With his jolly chaplains three;<br />
And he swears that he has an open pass<br />
&nbsp; From Jem of Netherbee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little John has ta&rsquo;en an arrow so broad,<br />
&nbsp; And broken it o&rsquo;er his knee;<br />
&ldquo;Now may I never strike doe again,<br />
&nbsp; But this wrong avenged shall be!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And has he dared, this greasy frere,<br />
&nbsp; To trespass in my bound,<br />
Nor asked for leave from Little John<br />
&nbsp; To range with hawk and hound?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And has he dared to take a pass<br />
&nbsp; From Jem of Netherbee,<br />
Forgetting that the Sherwood shaws<br />
&nbsp; Pertain of right to me?</p>
<p><!-- page 190--><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>&ldquo;O were he but a simple man,<br />
&nbsp; And not a slip-shod frere!<br />
I&rsquo;d hang him up by his own waist-rope<br />
&nbsp; Above yon tangled brere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O did he come alone from Jem,<br />
&nbsp; And not from our father the Pope,<br />
I&rsquo;d bring him into Copmanshurst,<br />
&nbsp; With the noose of a hempen rope!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But since he has come from our father the Pope,<br />
&nbsp; And sailed across the sea,<br />
And since he has power to bind and lose,<br />
&nbsp; His life is safe for me;<br />
But a heavy penance he shall do<br />
&nbsp; Beneath the greenwood tree!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O tarry yet!&rdquo; quoth Charlie Wood,<br />
&nbsp; &ldquo;O tarry, master mine!<br />
It&rsquo;s ill to shear a yearling hog,<br />
&nbsp; Or twist the wool of swine!</p>
<p><!-- page 191--><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ill to make a bonny silk purse<br />
&nbsp; From the ear of a bristly boar;<br />
It&rsquo;s ill to provoke a shaveling&rsquo;s curse,<br />
&nbsp; When the way lies him before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve walked the forest for twenty years,<br />
&nbsp; In wet weather and dry,<br />
And never stopped a good fellowe,<br />
&nbsp; Who had no coin to buy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What boots it to search a beggarman&rsquo;s bags,<br />
&nbsp; When no silver groat he has?<br />
So, master mine, I rede you well,<br />
&nbsp; E&rsquo;en let the friar pass!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now cease thy prate,&rdquo; quoth Little John,<br />
&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou japest but in vain;<br />
An he have not a groat within his pouch,<br />
&nbsp; We may find a silver chain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But were he as bare as a new-flayed buck,<br />
&nbsp; As truly he may be,<br />
He shall not tread the Sherwood shaws<br />
&nbsp; Without the leave of me!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>Little John has taken his arrows and bow,<br />
&nbsp; His sword and buckler strong,<br />
And lifted up his quarter-staff,<br />
&nbsp; Was full three cloth yards long.</p>
<p>And he has left his merry men<br />
&nbsp; At the trysting-tree behind,<br />
And gone into the gay greenwood,<br />
&nbsp; This burly frere to find.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;er holt and hill, through brake and brere,<br />
&nbsp; He took his way alone&mdash;<br />
Now, Lordlings, list and you shall hear<br />
&nbsp; This geste of Little John.</p>
<h4>FYTTE THE SECOND.</h4>
<p>&rsquo;Tis merry, &rsquo;tis merry in gay greenwood,<br />
&nbsp; When the little birds are singing,<br />
When the buck is belling in the fern,<br />
&nbsp; And the hare from the thicket springing!</p>
<p><!-- page 193--><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>&rsquo;Tis merry to hear the waters clear,<br />
&nbsp; As they splash in the pebbly fall;<br />
And the ouzel whistling to his mate,<br />
&nbsp; As he lights on the stones so small.</p>
<p>But small pleasaunce took Little John<br />
&nbsp; In all he heard and saw;<br />
Till he reached the cave of a hermit old<br />
&nbsp; Who wonned within the shaw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ora pro nobis</i>!&rdquo; quoth Little John&mdash;<br />
&nbsp; His Latin was somewhat rude&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Now, holy father, hast thou seen<br />
&nbsp; A frere within the wood?</p>
<p>&ldquo;By his scarlet hose, and his ruddy nose,<br />
&nbsp; I guess you may know him well;<br />
And he wears on his head a hat so red,<br />
&nbsp; And a monstrous scallop-shell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have served Saint Pancras,&rdquo; the hermit said,<br />
&nbsp; &ldquo;In this cell for thirty year,<br />
Yet never saw I, in the forest bounds,<br />
&nbsp; The face of such a frere!</p>
<p><!-- page 194--><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>&ldquo;An&rsquo; if ye find him, master mine,<br />
&nbsp; E&rsquo;en take an old man&rsquo;s advice,<br />
An&rsquo; raddle him well, till he roar again,<br />
&nbsp; Lest ye fail to meet him twice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust me for that!&rdquo; quoth Little John&mdash;<br />
&nbsp; &ldquo;Trust me for that!&rdquo; quoth he, with a laugh;<br />
&ldquo;There never was man of woman born,<br />
&nbsp; That asked twice for the taste of my quarter-staff!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Little John, he strutted on,<br />
&nbsp; Till he came to an open bound,<br />
And he was aware of a Red Friar,<br />
&nbsp; Was sitting upon the ground.</p>
<p>His shoulders they were broad and strong,<br />
&nbsp; And large was he of limb;<br />
Few yeomen in the north countrie<br />
&nbsp; Would care to mell with him.</p>
<p>He heard the rustling of the boughs,<br />
&nbsp; As Little John drew near;<br />
But never a single word he spoke,<br />
&nbsp; Of welcome or of cheer:<br />
<!-- page 195--><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>Less stir he made than a pedlar would<br />
&nbsp; For a small gnat in his ear!</p>
<p>I like not his looks! thought Little John,<br />
&nbsp; Nor his staff of the oaken tree.<br />
Now may our Lady be my help,<br />
&nbsp; Else beaten I well may be!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What dost thou here, thou strong Friar,<br />
&nbsp; In Sherwood&rsquo;s merry round,<br />
Without the leave of Little John,<br />
&nbsp; To range with hawk and hound?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Small thought have I,&rdquo; quoth the Red Friar,<br />
&nbsp; &ldquo;Of any leave, I trow;<br />
That Little John is an outlawed thief,<br />
&nbsp; And so, I ween, art thou!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know, I am Prior of Copmanshurst,<br />
&nbsp; And Bishop of London town,<br />
And I bring a rope from our father the Pope,<br />
&nbsp; To put the outlaws down.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>Then out spoke Little John in wrath,<br />
&nbsp; &ldquo;I tell thee, burly frere,<br />
The Pope may do as he likes at home,<br />
&nbsp; But he sends no Bishops here!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up, and away, Red Friar!&rdquo; he said,<br />
&nbsp; &ldquo;Up, and away, right speedilie;<br />
An it were not for that cowl of thine,<br />
&nbsp; Avenged on thy body I would be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, heed not that,&rdquo; said the Red Friar,<br />
&nbsp; &ldquo;And let my cowl no hindrance be;<br />
I warrant that I can give as good<br />
&nbsp; As ever I think to take from thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little John he raised his quarter-staff,<br />
&nbsp; And so did the burly priest,<br />
And they fought beneath the greenwood tree<br />
&nbsp; A stricken hour at least.</p>
<p>But Little John was weak of fence,<br />
&nbsp; And his strength began to fail;<br />
Whilst the Friar&rsquo;s blows came thundering down,<br />
&nbsp; Like the strokes of a threshing-flail.</p>
<p><!-- page 197--><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>&ldquo;Now hold thy hand, thou stalwart Friar,<br />
&nbsp; Now rest beneath the thorn,<br />
Until I gather breath enow,<br />
&nbsp; For a blast at my bugle-horn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hold my hand,&rdquo; the Friar said,<br />
&nbsp; &ldquo;Since that is your propine,<br />
But, an you sound your bugle-horn,<br />
&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll even blow on mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little John he wound a blast so shrill,<br />
&nbsp; That it rang o&rsquo;er rock and linn,<br />
And Charlie Wood, and his merry men all,<br />
&nbsp; Came lightly bounding in.</p>
<p>The Friar he wound a blast so strong<br />
&nbsp; That it shook both bush and tree,<br />
And to his side came witless Will,<br />
&nbsp; And Jem of Netherbee;<br />
With all the worst of Robin&rsquo;s band,<br />
&nbsp; And many a Rapparee!</p>
<p><!-- page 198--><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>Little John he wist not what to do,<br />
&nbsp; When he saw the others come;<br />
So he twisted his quarter-staff between<br />
&nbsp; His fingers and his thumb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some mistake, good Friar!&rdquo; he said,<br />
&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some mistake &rsquo;twixt thee and me;<br />
I know thou art Prior of Copmanshurst,<br />
&nbsp; But not beneath the greenwood tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if you will take some other name,<br />
&nbsp; You shall have ample leave to bide;<br />
With pasture also for your Bulls,<br />
&nbsp; And power to range the forest wide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no mistake!&rdquo; the Friar said;<br />
&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call myself just what I please.<br />
My doctrine is that chalk is chalk,<br />
&nbsp; And cheese is nothing else than cheese.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So be it, then!&rdquo; quoth Little John;<br />
&nbsp; &ldquo;But surely you will not object,<br />
If I and all my merry men<br />
&nbsp; Should treat you with reserved respect?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><!-- page 199--><a name="page199"></a><span

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t call you Prior of Copmanshurst,<br />
&nbsp; Nor Bishop of London town,<br />
Nor on the grass, as you chance to pass,<br />
&nbsp; Can we very well kneel down.</p>
<p><!-- page 200--><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll send the Pope my compliments,<br />
&nbsp; And say, as a further hint,<br />
That, within the Sherwood bounds, you saw<br />
Little John, who is the son-in-law<br />
&nbsp; Of his friend, old Mat-o&rsquo;-the-Mint!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So ends this geste of Little John&mdash;<br />
&nbsp; God save our noble Queen!<br />
But, Lordlings, say&mdash;Is Sherwood now<br />
&nbsp; What Sherwood once hath been? <a name="citation200"></a><a

<h3>The Rhyme of Sir Launcelot Bogle.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">a legend of glasgow</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">by mrs e--- b--- b---</span>.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a pleasant place of rest, near a City of the West,<br />
&nbsp; Where its bravest and its best find their grave.<br />
<!-- page 202--><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>Below the willows weep, and their hoary branches steep<br />
&nbsp; In the waters still and deep,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Not a wave!</p>
<p>And the old Cathedral Wall, so scathed and grey and tall,<br />
&nbsp; Like a priest surveying all, stands beyond;<br />
And the ringing of its bell, when the ringers ring it well,<br />
&nbsp; Makes a kind of tidal swell<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  On the pond!</p>
<p>And there it was I lay, on a beauteous summer&rsquo;s day,<br />
&nbsp; With the odour of the hay floating by;<br />
And I heard the blackbirds sing, and the bells demurely ring,<br />
&nbsp; Chime by chime, ting by ting,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Droppingly.</p>
<p>Then my thoughts went wandering back, on a very beaten track,<br />
&nbsp; To the confine deep and black of the tomb;<br />
<!-- page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>And I wondered who he was, that is laid beneath the grass,<br />
&nbsp; Where the dandelion has<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Such a bloom.</p>
<p>Then I straightway did espy, with my slantly-sloping eye,<br />
&nbsp; A carv&egrave;d stone hard by, somewhat worn;<br />
And I read in letters cold&mdash;Here.lyes.Launcelot.ye.bolde,<br />
&nbsp; Off.ye.race.off.Bogile.old,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Glasgow.borne.</p>
<p>He.wals.ane.valyaunt.knychte.maist.terrible.in.fychte.<br />
&nbsp; Here the letters failed outright, but I knew<br />
That a stout crusading lord, who had crossed the Jordan&rsquo;s ford,<br />
&nbsp; Lay there beneath the sward,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Wet with dew.</p>
<p>Time and tide they passed away, on that pleasant summer&rsquo;s day,<br
/>
&nbsp; And around me, as I lay, all grew old:<br />
<!-- page 204--><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>Sank the chimneys from the town, and the clouds of vapour
brown<br />
&nbsp; No longer, like a crown,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  O&rsquo;er it rolled.</p>
<p>Sank the great Saint Rollox stalk, like a pile of dingy chalk;<br />
&nbsp; Disappeared the cypress walk, and the flowers;<br />
And a donjon-keep arose, that might baffle any foes,<br />
&nbsp; With its men-at-arms in rows,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  On the towers.</p>
<p>And the flag that flaunted there showed the grim and grizzly bear,<br />
&nbsp; Which the Bogles always wear for their crest.<br />
And I heard the warder call, as he stood upon the wall,<br />
&nbsp; &ldquo;Wake ye up! my comrades all,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  From your rest!</p>
<p>&ldquo;For, by the blessed rood, there&rsquo;s a glimpse of armour
good<br />
&nbsp; In the deep Cowcaddens wood, o&rsquo;er the stream;<br />
<!-- page 205--><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>And I hear the stifled hum of a multitude that come,<br />
&nbsp; Though they have not beat the drum,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  It would seem!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go tell it to my Lord, lest he wish to man the ford<br />
&nbsp; With partisan and sword, just beneath;<br />
Ho, Gilkison and Nares!&nbsp; Ho, Provan of Cowlairs!<br />
&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll back the bonny bears<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  To the death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the tower above the moat, like one who heedeth not,<br />
&nbsp; Came the bold Sir Launcelot, half undressed;<br />
On the outer rim he stood, and peered into the wood,<br />
&nbsp; With his arms across him glued<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  On his breast.</p>
<p>And he muttered, &ldquo;Foe accurst! hast thou dared to seek me
first?<br />
&nbsp; George of Gorbals, do thy worst&mdash;for I swear,<br />
O&rsquo;er thy gory corpse to ride, ere thy sister and my bride,<br />
&nbsp; From my undissevered side<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Thou shalt tear!</p>
<p><!-- page 206--><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>&ldquo;Ho, herald mine, Brownlee! ride forth, I pray, and see,<br
/>
&nbsp; Who, what, and whence is he, foe or friend!<br />
Sir Roderick Dalgleish, and my foster-brother Neish,<br />
&nbsp; With his bloodhounds in the leash,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Shall attend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forth went the herald stout, o&rsquo;er the drawbridge and without,<br
/>
&nbsp; Then a wild and savage shout rose amain,<br />
Six arrows sped their force, and, a pale and bleeding corse,<br />
&nbsp; He sank from off his horse<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  On the plain!</p>
<p>Back drew the bold Dalgleish, back started stalwart Neish,<br />
&nbsp; With his bloodhounds in the leash, from Brownlee.<br />
&ldquo;Now shame be to the sword that made thee knight and lord,<br />
&nbsp; Thou caitiff thrice abhorred,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Shame on thee!</p>
<p><!-- page 207--><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>&ldquo;Ho, bowmen, bend your bows!&nbsp; Discharge upon the
foes<br />
&nbsp; Forthwith no end of those heavy bolts.<br />
Three angels to the brave who finds the foe a grave,<br />
&nbsp; And a gallows for the slave<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Who revolts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten days the combat lasted; but the bold defenders fasted,<br />
&nbsp; While the foemen, better pastied, fed their host;<br />
You might hear the savage cheers of the hungry Gorbaliers,<br />
&nbsp; As at night they dressed the steers<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  For the roast.</p>
<p>And Sir Launcelot grew thin, and Provan&rsquo;s double chin<br />
&nbsp; Showed sundry folds of skin down beneath;<br />
In silence and in grief found Gilkison relief,<br />
&nbsp; Nor did Neish the spell-word, beef,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Dare to breathe.</p>
<p><!-- page 208--><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>To the ramparts Edith came, that fair and youthful dame,<br />
&nbsp; With the rosy evening flame on her face.<br />
She sighed, and looked around on the soldiers on the ground,<br />
&nbsp; Who but little penance found,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Saying grace!</p>
<p>And she said unto her lord, as he leaned upon his sword,<br />
&nbsp; &ldquo;One short and little word may I speak?<br />
I cannot bear to view those eyes so ghastly blue,<br />
&nbsp; Or mark the sallow hue<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Of thy cheek!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the rage and wrath that my furious brother hath<br />
&nbsp; Is less against us both than at me.<br />
Then, dearest, let me go, to find among the foe<br />
&nbsp; An arrow from the bow,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Like Brownlee!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 209--><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>&ldquo;I would soil my father&rsquo;s name, I would lose my

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Said the knight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All our chances are not lost, as your brother and his host<br />
&nbsp; Shall discover to their cost rather hard!<br />
Ho, Provan! take this key&mdash;hoist up the Malvoisie,<br />
&nbsp; And heap it, d&rsquo;ye see,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  In the yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of usquebaugh and rum, you will find, I reckon, some,<br />
&nbsp; Besides the beer and mum, extra stout;<br />
Go straightway to your tasks, and roll me all the casks,<br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Just without.</p>

210</span>&ldquo;If I know the Gorbaliers, they are sure to dip their
ears<br />
&nbsp; In the very inmost tiers of the drink.<br />
Let them win the outer court, and hold it for their sport,<br />
&nbsp; Since their time is rather short,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  I should think!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a loud triumphant yell, as the heavy drawbridge fell,<br />
&nbsp; Rushed the Gorbaliers pell-mell, wild as Druids;<br />
Mad with thirst for human gore, how they threatened and they swore,<br />
&nbsp; Till they stumbled on the floor,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  O&rsquo;er the fluids.</p>
<p>Down their weapons then they threw, and each savage soldier drew<br />
&nbsp; From his belt an iron screw, in his fist;<br />
George of Gorbals found it vain their excitement to restrain,<br />
&nbsp; And indeed was rather fain<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  To assist.</p>
<p><!-- page 211--><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>With a beaker in his hand, in the midst he took his stand,<br />
&nbsp; And silence did command, all below&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Ho! Launcelot the bold, ere thy lips are icy cold,<br />
&nbsp; In the centre of thy hold,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Pledge me now!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Art surly, brother mine?&nbsp; In this cup of rosy wine,<br />
&nbsp; I drink to the decline of thy race!<br />
Thy proud career is done, thy sand is nearly run,<br />
&nbsp; Never more shall setting sun<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Gild thy face!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pilgrim, in amaze, shall see a goodly blaze,<br />
&nbsp; Ere the pallid morning rays flicker up;<br />
And perchance he may espy certain corpses swinging high!<br />
&nbsp; What, brother! art thou dry?<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Fill my cup!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dumb as death stood Launcelot, as though he heard him not,<br />
&nbsp; But his bosom Provan smote, and he swore;<br />
<!-- page 212--><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>And Sir Roderick Dalgleish remarked aside to Neish,<br />
&nbsp; &ldquo;Never sure did thirsty fish<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Swallow more!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty casks are nearly done, yet the revel&rsquo;s scarce
begun;<br />
&nbsp; It were knightly sport and fun to strike in!&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Nay, tarry till they come,&rdquo; quoth Neish, &ldquo;unto the
rum&mdash;<br />
&nbsp; They are working at the mum,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  And the gin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then straight there did appear to each gallant Gorbalier<br />
&nbsp; Twenty castles dancing near, all around;<br />
The solid earth did shake, and the stones beneath them quake,<br />
&nbsp; And sinuous as a snake<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Moved the ground.</p>
<p>Why and wherefore they had come, seemed intricate to some,<br />
&nbsp; But all agreed the rum was divine.<br />
<!-- page 213--><a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>And they looked with bitter scorn on their leader highly born,<br
/>
&nbsp; Who preferred to fill his horn<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Up with wine!</p>
<p>Then said Launcelot the tall, &ldquo;Bring the chargers from their
stall;<br />
&nbsp; Lead them straight unto the hall, down below:<br />
Draw your weapons from your side, fling the gates asunder wide,<br />
&nbsp; And together we shall ride<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  On the foe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Provan knew full well, as he leaped into his selle,<br />
&nbsp; That few would &rsquo;scape to tell how they fared;<br />
And Gilkison and Nares, both mounted on their mares,<br />
&nbsp; Looked terrible as bears,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  All prepared.</p>
<p>With his bloodhounds in the leash, stood the iron-sinewed Neish,<br />
&nbsp; And the falchion of Dalgleish glittered bright&mdash;<br />
<!-- page 214--><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>&ldquo;Now, wake the trumpet&rsquo;s blast; and, comrades, follow
fast;<br />
&nbsp; Smite them down unto the last!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Cried the knight.</p>
<p>In the cumbered yard without, there was shriek, and yell, and shout,<br
/>
&nbsp; As the warriors wheeled about, all in mail.<br />
On the miserable kerne fell the death-strokes stiff and stern,<br />
&nbsp; As the deer treads down the fern,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  In the vale!</p>
<p>Saint Mungo be my guide!&nbsp; It was goodly in that tide<br />
&nbsp; To see the Bogle ride in his haste;<br />
He accompanied each blow with a cry of &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Ho!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp; And always cleft the foe<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  To the waist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;George of Gorbals&mdash;craven lord! thou didst threat me with
the cord;<br />
&nbsp; Come forth and brave my sword, if you dare!&rdquo;<br />
<!-- page 215--><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>But he met with no reply, and never could descry<br />
&nbsp; The glitter of his eye<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Anywhere.</p>
<p>Ere the dawn of morning shone, all the Gorbaliers were down,<br />
&nbsp; Like a field of barley mown in the ear:<br />
It had done a soldier good to see how Provan stood,<br />
&nbsp; With Neish all bathed in blood,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Panting near.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now bend ye to your tasks&mdash;go trundle down those casks,<br
/>
&nbsp; And place the empty flasks on the floor;<br />
George of Gorbals scarce will come, with trumpet and with drum,<br />
&nbsp; To taste our beer and rum<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Any more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they bent them to their tasks, and they trundled down the casks,<br
/>
&nbsp; And replaced the empty flasks on the floor;<br />
<!-- page 216--><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>But pallid for a week was the cellar-master&rsquo;s cheek,<br />
&nbsp; For he swore he heard a shriek<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Through the door.</p>
<p>When the merry Christmas came, and the Yule-log lent its flame<br />
&nbsp; To the face of squire and dame in the hall,<br />
The cellarer went down to tap October brown,<br />
&nbsp; Which was rather of renown<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  &rsquo;Mongst them all.</p>
<p>He placed the spigot low, and gave the cask a blow,<br />
&nbsp; But his liquor would not flow through the pin.<br />
&ldquo;Sure, &rsquo;tis sweet as honeysuckles!&rdquo; so he rapped it with
his knuckles,<br />
&nbsp; But a sound, as if of buckles,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Clashed within.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring a hatchet, varlets, here!&rdquo; and they cleft the cask of
beer:<br />
&nbsp; What a spectacle of fear met their sight!<br />
<!-- page 217--><a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>There George of Gorbals lay, skull and bones all blanched and
grey,<br />
&nbsp; In the arms he bore the day<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Of the fight!</p>
<p>I have sung this ancient tale, not, I trust, without avail,<br />
&nbsp; Though the moral ye may fail to perceive;<br />
Sir Launcelot is dust, and his gallant sword is rust,<br />
&nbsp; And now, I think, I must<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Take my leave!</p>

219</span>ILLUSTRATIONS<br />
OF<br />
THE PUFF POETICAL</h2>
<p><!-- page 220--><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>[The following eleven pieces of verse appeared originally with
many others in an article called &ldquo;Puffs and Poetry,&rdquo; from which
the following passage is taken:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some people are fond of excursions into the realms of old
romance, with their Lancelots and Gueneveres, their enchanted castles,
their bearded wizards, &lsquo;and such odd branches of
learning.&rsquo;&nbsp; There needs a winged griffin, at the very least, to
carry them out of the everyday six-and-eightpenny world, or the whizz of an
Excalibur to startle their drowsy imaginations into life.&nbsp; The
beauties and the wonders of the universe died for them some centuries ago;
they went out with Friar Bacon and the invention of gunpowder.&nbsp;
Praised be Apollo! this is not our case.&nbsp; There is a snatch of poetry,
to our apprehension, in almost everything.&nbsp; We have detected it
pushing its petals forth from the curls of a barrister&rsquo;s wig, and
scented its fragrance even in the columns of the &lsquo;London
Gazette.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The deep poetic voice that hourly speaks within us&rsquo;
is never silent.&nbsp; Like Signor Benedick, it &lsquo;will still be
talking.&rsquo;&nbsp; We can scarcely let our eyes dwell upon an
object&mdash;nay, not even upon a gridiron or a toothpick&mdash;but it
seems to be transmuted as by the touch of Midas into gold.&nbsp; Our facts
accordingly adopt upon occasions a very singular shape.&nbsp; We are not
nice to a shade.&nbsp; A trifle here or there never stands in our
way.&nbsp; We regard a free play of fancy as the privilege of every genuine
Briton, and exclaim with Pistol, &lsquo;A fico for all yea and nay
rogues.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have often thought of entering the lists against Robins
[famous for his imaginative advertisements of properties for sale].&nbsp;
It may be vanity, but we think we could trump him.&nbsp; Robins amplifies
well, but we think we could trump him.&nbsp; There is an obvious effort in
his best works.&nbsp; The result is a want of unity of effect.&nbsp; Hesiod
and Tennyson, the Caverns of Ellora, and the magic caves of the
Regent&rsquo;s Park Colosseum, are jumbled confusedly one upon
another.&nbsp; He never achieves the triumph of art&mdash;repose.&nbsp;
Besides, he wants variety.&nbsp; A country box, consisting of twenty feet
square of tottering brickwork, a plateau of dirt, with a few diseased
shrubs and an open drain, is as elaborately be-metaphored as an island of
the Hebrides, with a wilderness of red-deer, Celts, ptarmigan, and other
wild animals upon it.&nbsp; Now, this is out of all rule.&nbsp; An
elephant&rsquo;s trunk can raise a pin as well as uproot an oak, but it
would be ridiculous to employ the same effort for one as for the
other.&nbsp; Robins&mdash;with reverence to so great a name, be it
spoken&mdash;does not attend to this.&nbsp; He has yet to acquire the light
and graceful touch of the finished artist.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon Bon
Gaultier proceeds to illustrate his views by the following, and many other
rhyming advertisements.]</p>

<p>Died the Jew?&nbsp; &ldquo;The Hebrew died.<br />

The Nereid rushes in between,<br />

<p>Died the Jew?&nbsp; &ldquo;The Hebrew died.<br />
&nbsp; They raised him gently from the stone,<br />
They flung his coat and neckcloth wide&mdash;<br />
&nbsp; But linen had that Hebrew none.<br />
They raised the pile of hats that pressed<br />
&nbsp; His noble head, his locks of snow;<br />
But, ah, that head, upon his breast,<br />
&nbsp; Sank down with an expiring &lsquo;Clo!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

223</span>Parr&rsquo;s Life Pills.</h3>
<p>&rsquo;Twas in the town of Lubeck,<br />
&nbsp; A hundred years ago,<br />
An old man walked into the church,<br />
&nbsp; With beard as white as snow;<br />
Yet were his cheeks not wrinkled,<br />
&nbsp; Nor dim his eagle eye:<br />
There&rsquo;s many a knight that steps the street,<br />
Might wonder, should he chance to meet<br />
&nbsp; That man erect and high!</p>
<p>When silenced was the organ,<br />
&nbsp; And hushed the vespers loud,<br />
The Sacristan approached the sire,<br />
&nbsp; And drew him from the crowd&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something in thy visage,<br />
&nbsp; <!-- page 224--><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>On which I dare not look;<br />
And when I rang the passing bell,<br />
A tremor that I may not tell,<br />
&nbsp; My very vitals shook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who art thou, awful stranger?<br />
&nbsp; Our ancient annals say,<br />
That twice two hundred years ago<br />
&nbsp; Another passed this way,<br />
Like thee in face and feature;<br />
&nbsp; And, if the tale be true,<br />
&rsquo;Tis writ, that in this very year<br />
Again the stranger shall appear.<br />
&nbsp; Art thou the Wandering Jew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Wandering Jew, thou dotard!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp; The wondrous phantom cried&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis several centuries ago<br />
&nbsp; Since that poor stripling died.<br />
He would not use my nostrums&mdash;<br />

226</span>Tarquin and the Augur.</h3>
<p>Gingerly is good King Tarquin shaving.<br />
&nbsp; Gently glides the razor o&rsquo;er his chin,<br />
Near him stands a grim Haruspex raving,<br />
&nbsp; And with nasal whine he pitches in<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Church extension hints,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Till the monarch squints,<br />
Snicks his chin, and swears&mdash;a deadly sin!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jove confound thee, thou bare-legged impostor!<br />
&nbsp; From my dressing-table get thee gone!<br />
Dost thou think my flesh is double Glo&rsquo;ster?<br />
&nbsp; There again!&nbsp; That cut was to the bone!<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Get ye from my sight;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I&rsquo;ll believe you&rsquo;re
right,<br />
When my razor cuts the sharpening hone!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 227--><a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>Thus spoke Tarquin with a deal of dryness;<br />
&nbsp; But the Augur, eager for his fees,<br />
Answered&mdash;&ldquo;Try it, your Imperial Highness;<br />
&nbsp; Press a little harder, if you please.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There! the deed is done!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Through the solid stone<br />
Went the steel as glibly as through cheese.</p>
<p>So the Augur touched the tin of Tarquin,<br />
&nbsp; Who suspected some celestial aid;<br />
But he wronged the blameless gods; for hearken!<br />
&nbsp; Ere the monarch&rsquo;s bet was rashly laid,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With his searching eye<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Did the priest espy<br />

<p>Slowly, as one who bears a mortal hurt,<br />
Through which the fountain of his life runs dry,<br />
Crept good King Arthur down unto the lake.<br />
A roughening wind was bringing in the waves<br />
With cold dull plash and plunging to the shore,<br />
And a great bank of clouds came sailing up<br />
Athwart the aspect of the gibbous moon,<br />
Leaving no glimpse save starlight, as he sank,<br />
With a short stagger, senseless on the stones.</p>
<p>&nbsp; No man yet knows how long he lay in swound;<br />
But long enough it was to let the rust<br />
Lick half the surface of his polished shield;<br />
For it was made by far inferior hands,<br />
Than forged his helm, his breastplate, and his greaves,<br />
Whereon no canker lighted, for they bore<br />
The magic stamp of <span class="smcap">Mechi&rsquo;s Silver
Steel</span>.</p>

&nbsp; Whence thy cheek&rsquo;s enchanting bloom?<br />
Whence the rosy hue thou wearest;<br />

<p>Thus he spoke, with heart that panted,<br />
&nbsp; Clasped her fondly to his side,<br />
Gazed on her with look enchanted,<br />
&nbsp; While his Helen thus replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be no discord, love, between us,<br />
&nbsp; If I not the secret tell!<br />
&rsquo;Twas a gift I had of Venus,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp; Venus, who hath loved me well;</p>

&nbsp; &lsquo;Let not e&rsquo;er the charm be known;<br />

<p>Long with vow and kiss he plied her;<br />
&nbsp; Still the secret did she keep,<br />
Till at length he sank beside her,<br />
&nbsp; Seemed as he had dropped to sleep.</p>
<p>Soon was Helen laid in slumber,<br />
&nbsp; When her Paris, rising slow,<br />
Did his fair neck disencumber<br />
&nbsp; From her rounded arms of snow.</p>
<p>Then, her heedless fingers oping,<br />
&nbsp; Takes the key and steals away,<br />
To the ebon table groping,<br />
&nbsp; Where the wondrous casket lay;</p>

<p>I would all womankind were dead,<br />
&nbsp; Or banished o&rsquo;er the sea;<br />
For they have been a bitter plague<br />
&nbsp; These last six weeks to me:<br />
It is not that I&rsquo;m touched myself,<br />
&nbsp; For that I do not fear;<br />
<!-- page 246--><a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>No

To quaff the pleasant cider-cup,<br />
&nbsp; And feed on fish and fun;<br />
Or climb the slopes of Richmond Hill,<br />
&nbsp; To catch a breath of air:<br />
Then, for my sins, he straight begins<br />
&nbsp; To rave about his fair.<br />

<h3>Francesca Da Rimini.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">to bon gaultier</span>.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Argument</span>.&mdash;An impassioned pupil of
Leigh Hunt, having met Bon Gaultier at a Fancy Ball, declares the
destructive consequences thus.]</p>
<p>Didst thou not praise me, Gaultier, at the ball,<br />
Ripe lips, trim boddice, and a waist so small,<br />
With clipsome lightness, dwindling ever less,<br />
Beneath the robe of pea-y greeniness?<br />
Dost thou remember, when, with stately prance,<br />
Our heads went crosswise in the country-dance;<br />
How soft, warm fingers, tipped like buds of balm,<br />
Trembled within the squeezing of thy palm;<br />
<!-- page 250--><a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
250</span>And how a cheek grew flushed and peachy-wise<br />
At the frank lifting of thy cordial eyes?<br />
Ah, me! that night there was one gentle thing,<br />
Who, like a dove, with its scarce feathered wing,<br />
Fluttered at the approach of thy quaint swaggering!</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s wont to be, at conscious times like these,<br />
An affectation of a bright-eyed ease,&mdash;<br />
A crispy cheekiness, if so I dare<br />
Describe the swaling of a jaunty air;<br />
And thus, when swirling from the waltz&rsquo;s wheel,<br />
You craved my hand to grace the next quadrille,<br />
That smiling voice, although it made me start,<br />
Boiled in the meek o&rsquo;erlifting of my heart;<br />
And, picking at my flowers, I said, with free<br />
And usual tone, &ldquo;O yes, sir, certainly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like one that swoons, &rsquo;twixt sweet amaze and fear,<br />
I heard the music burning in my ear,<br />
And felt I cared not, so thou wert with me,<br />
If Gurth or Wamba were our vis-&agrave;-vis.<br />
So, when a tall Knight Templar ringing came,<br />
And took his place amongst us with his dame,<br />
I neither turned away, nor bashful shrunk<br />
From the stern survey of the soldier-monk,<br />
<!-- page 251--><a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
251</span>Though rather more than three full quarters drunk;<br />
But, threading through the figure, first in rule,<br />
I paused to see thee plunge into La Poule.</p>
<p>Ah, what a sight was that!&nbsp; Not prurient Mars,<br />
Pointing his toe through ten celestial bars&mdash;<br />
Not young Apollo, beamily arrayed<br />
In tripsome guise for Juno&rsquo;s masquerade&mdash;<br />
Not smartest Hermes, with his pinion girth,<br />
Jerking with freaks and snatches down to earth,<br />
Looked half so bold, so beautiful, and strong,<br />
As thou, when pranking through the glittering throng!<br />
How the calmed ladies looked with eyes of love<br />
On thy trim velvet doublet laced above;<br />
The hem of gold, that, like a wavy river,<br />
Flowed down into thy back with glancing shiver!<br />
So bare was thy fine throat, and curls of black,<br />
So lightsomely dropped in thy lordly back,<br />
So crisply swaled the feather in thy bonnet,<br />
So glanced thy thigh, and spanning palm upon it,<br />
That my weak soul took instant flight to thee,<br />
Lost in the fondest gush of that sweet witchery!</p>
<p>But when the dance was o&rsquo;er, and arm in arm<br />
(The full heart beating &rsquo;gainst the elbow warm)<br />
<!-- page 252--><a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>We
passed into the great refreshment-hall,<br />
Where the heaped cheese-cakes and the comfits small<br />
Lay, like a hive of sunbeams, brought to burn<br />
Around the margin of the negus urn;<br />
When my poor quivering hand you fingered twice,<br />
And, with inquiring accents, whispered &ldquo;Ice,<br />
Water, or cream?&rdquo; I could no more dissemble,<br />
But dropped upon the couch all in a tremble.<br />
A swimming faintness misted o&rsquo;er my brain,<br />
The corks seemed starting from the brisk champagne,<br />
The custards fell untouched upon the floor,<br />
Thine eyes met mine.&nbsp; That night we danced no more!</p>

<p>How beauteous is the star of night<br />
&nbsp; Within the eastern skies,<br />

And the gay kiosk and the shadowy mosque<br />

&nbsp; And she hears the bulbul sing,<br />
As it thrills its throat to the first full note,<br />

She gazes still, as a maiden will,<br />
&nbsp; On that beauteous eastern star:<br />
You might see the throb of her bosom&rsquo;s sob<br />
&nbsp; Beneath the white cymar!</p>
<p>She thinks of him who is far away,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp; Her own brave Galiongee,&mdash;<br />
Where the billows foam and the breezes roam,<br />
&nbsp; On the wild Carpathian sea.<br />
She thinks of the oath that bound them both<br />
&nbsp; Beside the stormy water;<br />
And the words of love, that in Athens&rsquo; grove<br />
&nbsp; He spake to the Cadi&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p><!-- page 255--><a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp; In my heart&rsquo;s pellucid well,<br />
As the rose looks up to Phingari&rsquo;s orb,<br />

<p>&ldquo;I think of the time when the Kaftan&rsquo;s crime<br />
&nbsp; Our love&rsquo;s young joys o&rsquo;ertook,<br />
And thy name still floats in the plaintive notes<br />
&nbsp; Of my silver-toned chibouque.<br />
Thy hand is red with the blood it has shed,<br />
&nbsp; Thy soul it is heavy laden;<br />
Yet come, my Giaour, to thy Leila&rsquo;s bower;<br />
&nbsp; Oh, come to thy Turkish maiden!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A light step trod on the dewy sod,<br />
&nbsp; And a voice was in her ear,<br />
And an arm embraced young Leila&rsquo;s waist&mdash;<br />
&nbsp; &ldquo;Belov&egrave;d!&nbsp; I am here!&rdquo;<br />
<!-- page 256--><a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp; As he fondly bent above her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak, Leila, speak; for my light ca&iuml;que<br />

I have come from my rest to her I love best,<br />
&nbsp; To carry thee, love, away.<br />
The breast of thy lover shall shield thee, and cover<br />
&nbsp; My own jemscheed from harm;<br />
Think&rsquo;st thou I fear the dark vizier,<br />
&nbsp; Or the mufti&rsquo;s vengeful arm?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then droop not, love, nor turn away<br />
&nbsp; From this rude hand of mine!&rdquo;<br />
And Leila looked in her lover&rsquo;s eyes,<br />
&nbsp; And murmured&mdash;&ldquo;I am thine!&rdquo;<br />
But a gloomy man with a yataghan.<br />
&nbsp; Stole through the acacia-blossoms,<br />
And the thrust he made with his gleaming blade<br />

resolution and intrepidity!&nbsp; What volleys of sighs are sent from the

disgrace!&nbsp; I see him at the tree! the whole circle are in tears! even
butchers weep!&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Beggars Opera</span>.]</p>
<p>A living sea of eager human faces,<br />
&nbsp; A thousand bosoms throbbing all as one,<br />
Walls, windows, balconies, all sorts of places,<br />
&nbsp; Holding their crowds of gazers to the sun:<br />
&nbsp; Through the hushed groups low-buzzing murmurs run;<br />
And on the air, with slow reluctant swell,<br />
Comes the dull funeral-boom of old Sepulchre&rsquo;s bell.</p>
<p>Oh, joy in London now! in festal measure<br />

Will issue forth, serene, to glad and greet you all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why comes he not?&nbsp; Say, wherefore doth he tarry?&rdquo;<br

&nbsp; Starts the inquiry loud from every tongue.<br />
&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; they cry, &ldquo;that tedious Ordinary<br />

But hark! old Newgate&rsquo;s doors fly wide apart.<br />
&ldquo;He comes, he comes!&rdquo;&nbsp; A thrill shoots through each

<p>Joined in the stunning cry ten thousand voices,<br />
&nbsp; All Smithfield answered to the loud acclaim.<br />
&ldquo;He comes, he comes!&rdquo; and every breast rejoices,<br />
&nbsp; As down Snow Hill the shout tumultuous came,<br />
&nbsp; Bearing to Holborn&rsquo;s crowd the welcome fame.<br />

&nbsp; Hymned in full many an elegiac rhyme.<br />
He left his deeds behind him, and his name&mdash;<br />
For he, like C&aelig;sar, had lived long enough for fame.</p>
<p>He quailed not, save when, as he raised the chalice,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp; St Giles&rsquo;s bowl,&mdash;filled with the mildest ale,<br />
To pledge the crowd, on her&mdash;his beauteous Alice&mdash;<br />
&nbsp; His eye alighted, and his cheek grew pale.<br />
&nbsp; She, whose sweet breath was like the spicy gale,<br />
She, whom he fondly deemed his own dear girl,<br />
Stood with a tall dragoon, drinking long draughts of purl.</p>
<p>He bit his lip&mdash;it quivered but a moment&mdash;<br />
&nbsp; Then passed his hand across his flushing brows:<br />
He could have spared so forcible a comment<br />
&nbsp; Upon the constancy of woman&rsquo;s vows.<br />
&nbsp; One short sharp pang his hero-soul allows;<br />
But in the bowl he drowned the stinging pain,<br />
And on his pilgrim course went calmly forth again.</p>

&nbsp; Stood in a balcony suffused with grief,<br />
Diffusing fragrance round them, of strong waters,<br />
&nbsp; And waving many a snowy handkerchief;<br />
&nbsp; Then glowed the prince of highwayman and thief!<br />
His soul was touched with a seraphic gleam&mdash;<br />
That woman could be false was but a mocking dream.</p>
<p>And now, his bright career of triumph ended,<br />
&nbsp; His chariot stood beneath the triple tree.<br />
The law&rsquo;s grim finisher to its boughs ascended,<br />
&nbsp; And fixed the hempen bandages, while he<br />
&nbsp; Bowed to the throng, then bade the cart go free.<br />
The car rolled on, and left him dangling there,<br />
Like famed Mohammed&rsquo;s tomb, uphung midway in air.</p>
<p>As droops the cup of the surcharg&egrave;d lily<br />
&nbsp; Beneath the buffets of the surly storm,<br />
Or the soft petals of the daffodilly,<br />
&nbsp; When Sirius is uncomfortably warm,<br />
&nbsp; So drooped his head upon his manly form,<br />
While floated in the breeze his tresses brown.<br />
He hung the stated time, and then they cut him down.</p>

271</span>Dame Fredegonde.</h3>
<p>When folks, with headstrong passion blind,<br />
To play the fool make up their mind,<br />
They&rsquo;re sure to come with phrases nice<br />
And modest air, for your advice.<br />
But as a truth unfailing make it,<br />
They ask, but never mean to take it.<br />
&rsquo;Tis not advice they want, in fact,<br />
But confirmation in their act.<br />
Now mark what did, in such a case,<br />
A worthy priest who knew the race.</p>
<p>&nbsp; A dame more buxom, blithe, and free,<br />
Than Fredegonde you scarce would see.<br />
So smart her dress, so trim her shape,<br />
Ne&rsquo;er hostess offered juice of grape,<br />
Could for her trade wish better sign;<br />
Her looks gave flavour to her wine,<br />
<!-- page 272--><a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
272</span>And each guest feels it, as he sips,<br />
Smack of the ruby of her lips.<br />
A smile for all, a welcome glad,&mdash;<br />
A jovial coaxing way she had;<br />
And,&mdash;what was more her fate than blame,&mdash;<br />
A nine months&rsquo; widow was our dame.<br />
But toil was hard, for trade was good,<br />
And gallants sometimes will be rude.<br />
&ldquo;And what can a lone woman do?<br />
The nights are long and eerie too.<br />
Now, Guillot there&rsquo;s a likely man,<br />
None better draws or taps a can;<br />
He&rsquo;s just the man, I think, to suit,<br />
If I could bring my courage to&rsquo;t.&rdquo;<br />
With thoughts like these her mind is crossed:<br />
The dame, they say, who doubts, is lost.<br />
&ldquo;But then the risk?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll beg a slice<br />
Of Father Haulin&rsquo;s good advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Prankt in her best, with looks demure,<br />
She seeks the priest; and, to be sure,<br />
Asks if he thinks she ought to wed:<br />
<!-- page 273--><a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
273</span>&ldquo;With such a business on my head,<br />
I&rsquo;m worried off my legs with care,<br />
And need some help to keep things square.<br />
I&rsquo;ve thought of Guillot, truth to tell!<br />
He&rsquo;s steady, knows his business well.<br />
What do you think?&rdquo;&nbsp; When thus he met her:<br />
&ldquo;Oh, take him, dear, you can&rsquo;t do better!&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;But then the danger, my good pastor,<br />
If of the man I make the master.<br />
There is no trusting to these men.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Well, well, my dear, don&rsquo;t have him, then!&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;But help I must have; there&rsquo;s the curse.<br />
I may go farther and fare worse.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Why, take him, then!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But if he should<br />
Turn out a thankless ne&rsquo;er-do-good&mdash;<br />
In drink and riot waste my all,<br />
And rout me out of house and hall?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t have him, then!&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ve a plan<br />
To clear your doubts, if any can.<br />
The bells a peal are ringing,&mdash;hark!<br />
Go straight, and what they tell you mark.<br />
If they say &lsquo;Yes!&rsquo; wed, and be blest&mdash;<br />
If &lsquo;No,&rsquo; why&mdash;do as you think best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp; <!-- page 274--><a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
274</span>The bells rang out a triple bob:<br />
Oh, how our widow&rsquo;s heart did throb,<br />
As thus she heard their burden go,<br />
&ldquo;Marry, mar-marry, mar-Guillot!&rdquo;<br />
Bells were not then left to hang idle:<br />
A week,&mdash;and they rang for her bridal.<br />
But, woe the while, they might as well<br />
Have rung the poor dame&rsquo;s parting knell.<br />
The rosy dimples left her cheek,<br />
She lost her beauties plump and sleek;<br />
For Guillot oftener kicked than kissed,<br />
And backed his orders with his fist,<br />
Proving by deeds as well as words<br />
That servants make the worst of lords.</p>
<p>&nbsp; She seeks the priest, her ire to wreak,<br />
And speaks as angry women speak,<br />
With tiger looks and bosom swelling,<br />
Cursing the hour she took his telling.<br />
To all, his calm reply was this,&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;I fear you&rsquo;ve read the bells amiss:<br />
If they have lead you wrong in aught,<br />
Your wish, not they, inspired the thought.<br />
<!-- page 275--><a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
275</span>Just go, and mark well what they say.&rdquo;<br />
Off trudged the dame upon her way,<br />
And sure enough their chime went so,&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t have that knave, that knave Guillot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &ldquo;Too true,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s not a
doubt:<br />
What could my ears have been about?&rdquo;<br />
She had forgot, that, as fools think,<br />
The bell is ever sure to clink.</p>

276</span>Song of the Ennuy&eacute;.</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m weary, and sick, and disgusted<br />
&nbsp; With Britain&rsquo;s mechanical din;<br />
Where I&rsquo;m much too well known to be trusted,<br />
&nbsp; And plaguily pestered for tin;<br />
Where love has two eyes for your banker,<br />
&nbsp; And one chilly glance for yourself;<br />
Where souls can afford to be franker,<br />
&nbsp; But when they&rsquo;re well garnished with pelf.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sick of the whole race of poets,<br />
&nbsp; Emasculate, misty, and fine;<br />
They brew their small-beer, and don&rsquo;t know its<br />
&nbsp; Distinction from full-bodied wine.<br />
I&rsquo;m sick of the prosers, that house up<br />
&nbsp; At drowsy St Stephen&rsquo;s,&mdash;ain&rsquo;t you?<br />
I want some strong spirits to rouse up<br />
&nbsp; A good revolution or two!</p>
<p><!-- page 277--><a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp; Repeats the dull tale of to-day,<br />
Where you can&rsquo;t even find a new sorrow<br />
&nbsp; To chase your stale pleasures away.<br />
I&rsquo;m sick of blue-stockings horrific,<br />
&nbsp; Steam, railroads, gas, scrip, and consols;<br />
So I&rsquo;ll off where the golden Pacific<br />
&nbsp; Round Islands of Paradise rolls.</p>
<p>There the passions shall revel unfettered,<br />
&nbsp; And the heart never speak but in truth,<br />
And the intellect, wholly unlettered,<br />
&nbsp; Be bright with the freedom of youth!<br />
There the earth can rejoice in her blossoms,<br />
&nbsp; Unsullied by vapour or soot,<br />
And there chimpanzees and opossums<br />
&nbsp; Shall playfully pelt me with fruit.</p>
<p>There I&rsquo;ll sit with my dark Orianas,<br />
&nbsp; In groves by the murmuring sea,<br />
And they&rsquo;ll give, as I suck the bananas,<br />
&nbsp; Their kisses, nor ask them from me.<br />
<!-- page 278--><a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
278</span>They&rsquo;ll never torment me for sonnets,<br />
&nbsp; Nor bore me to death with their own;<br />
They&rsquo;ll ask not for shawls nor for bonnets,<br />
&nbsp; For milliners there are unknown.</p>
<p>There my couch shall be earth&rsquo;s freshest flowers,<br />
&nbsp; My curtains the night and the stars,<br />
And my spirit shall gather new powers,<br />
&nbsp; Uncramped by conventional bars.<br />
Love for love, truth for truth ever giving,<br />
&nbsp; My days shall be manfully sped;<br />
I shall know that I&rsquo;m loved while I&rsquo;m living,<br />
&nbsp; And be wept by fond eyes when I&rsquo;m dead!</p>

<p>Eternity shall raise her funeral-pile<br />

&nbsp; Shall live for aye, enjoying and enjoyed.</p>

<p>And when the King of Terrors breathes his last,<br />

Cause and effect shall from their thrones be cast,<br />

&nbsp; When singing to the rose,<br />
Is feebler than the agony<br />
&nbsp; That murders my repose!</p>
<p>Nay, dearest! do not doubt me,<br />

I feel thy arms about me,<br />
&nbsp; Thy tresses on my cheek:<br />
I know the sweet devotion<br />

&nbsp; Along the summer braes;</p>
<p>By all we felt, unspoken,<br />
&nbsp; When &rsquo;neath the early moon,<br />
We sat beside the rivulet,<br />
&nbsp; In the leafy month of June;<br />
And by the broken whisper<br />
&nbsp; That fell upon my ear,<br />
More sweet than angel music,<br />

<p><a name="footnoteix"></a><a href="#citationix"

cathedral chimes, and in Scotland, too, could ever have been chosen, will
scarcely be believed.&nbsp; But my astonished ears often heard it.</p>

<p><a name="footnote12"></a><a href="#citation12"
class="footnote">[12]</a>&nbsp; A not uncommon tribute from the gallery at
Astley&rsquo;s to the dash and daring of the heroes of the ring was
half-eaten oranges or fragments of orange-peel.&nbsp; Either oranges are
less in vogue, or manners are better in the galleries of theatres and
circuses in the present day.</p>
<p><a name="footnote18"></a><a href="#citation18"
class="footnote">[18]</a>&nbsp; The allusion here is to one of
Ducrow&rsquo;s remarkable feats.&nbsp; Entering the ring with the reins in
his hands of five horses abreast, and standing on the back of the centre
horse, he worked them round the ring at high speed, changing now and then
with marvellous dexterity their relative positions, and with his feet
always on more than one of them, ending with a foot on each of the extreme
two, so that, as described, &ldquo;the outer and the inner felt the
pressure of his toes.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote44"></a><a href="#citation44"

<p><a name="footnote117"></a><a href="#citation117"
class="footnote">[117]</a>&nbsp; The reference here and in a subsequent
verse is to a song very popular at the time:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;All round my hat I vears a green villow,<br />
All round my hat for a twelvemonth and a day,<br />
And if any van should arsk you the reason vy I vears it,<br />
Say, all for my true love that&rsquo;s far, far away.<br />
&rsquo;Twas agoin of my rounds on the streets I first did meet her,<br />
&rsquo;Twas agoin of my rounds that first she met my heye,<br />
And I never heard a voice more louder nor more sweeter,<br />
As she cried, &lsquo;Who&rsquo;ll buy my cabbages, my cabbages who&rsquo;ll
buy?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There were several more verses, and being set to a very taking air, it
was a reigning favourite with the &ldquo;Social Chucksters&rdquo; of the
day.&nbsp; Even scholars thought it worth turning into Latin verse.&nbsp; I
remember reading in some short-lived journal a very clever version of it,
the first verse of which ran thus&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Omne circa petusum sertum gero viridem<br />
Per annum circa petasum et unum diem plus.<br />
Si quis te rogaret, cur tale sertum gererem,<br />
Dic, &lsquo;Omne propter corculum qui est inpartibus.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Allusions to the willow, as an emblem of grief, are of a very old
date.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sing all, a green willow must be my garland,&rdquo; is
the refrain of the song which haunted Desdemona on the eve of her death
(Othello, act iv. sc. 3).&nbsp; That exquisite scene, and the beautiful air
to which some contemporary of Shakespeare wedded it, will make &ldquo;The
Willow Song&rdquo; immortal.</p>

Daniel Good were the two most talked about criminals of the time when these
lines were written.&nbsp; Madame Laffarge was convicted of poisoning her
husband under extenuating circumstances, and was imprisoned for life, but
many believed in her protestations of innocence&mdash;this, of course, she
being a woman and unhappily married.&nbsp; Daniel Good died on the scaffold
on the 23rd of May 1842, protesting his innocence to the last, and
asserting that his victim, Jane Sparks, had killed herself, an assertion
which a judge and jury naturally could not reconcile with the fact that her
head, arms, and legs had been cut off and hidden with her body in a
stable.&nbsp; He, too, found people to maintain that his sentence was
unjust.</p>

class="footnote">[122a]</a>&nbsp; The colonnaded portion of Regent Street,
immediately above the Regent Circus, was then called the Quadrant.&nbsp;
Being sheltered from the weather, it was a favourite promenade, but became
so favourite a resort of the &ldquo;larking&rdquo; population&mdash;male
and female&mdash;that the Colonnade was removed in the interests of social
order and decorum.</p>

signified by the application of the thumb of one hand to the nose,

symbolism.</p>

prolific author of the most sulphurous and sanguinary melodramas, flirted
also with the Muses.&nbsp; His triumph in this line was the ballad,
&ldquo;My Jane, my Jane, my pretty Jane,&rdquo; who was for many long years
implored in the delightful tenor notes of Sims Reeves &ldquo;never to look
so shy, and to meet him, meet him in the evening when the bloom was on the
rye.&rdquo;&nbsp; Fitzball, I have heard, was the meekest and least
bellicose of men, and this was probably the reason why he was dubbed by Bon

on Papal Aggression in November 1850 to the Bishop of Durham, provoked by
the Papal Bull creating Catholic bishops in England, and the angry
controversy to which it led, were followed by the passing of the
Ecclesiastic Titles Bill in 1857.&nbsp; Aytoun was not alone in thinking
that Cardinal Wiseman, the first to act upon the mandate from Rome, was
more than a match for Lord John, and that the Bill would become a dead
letter, as it did.&nbsp; The controversy was at its hottest when Aytoun
expressed his view of the probable result of the conflict in the preceding
ballad.</p>

class="footnote">[269]</a>&nbsp; This poem appeared in a review by Bon
Gaultier of an imaginary volume, &lsquo;The Poets of the Day,&rsquo; and
was in ridicule of the numerous verses of the time, to which the use of
Turkish words was supposed to impart a poetical flavour.&nbsp; His
reviewer&rsquo;s comment upon it was as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Had Byron been alive, or Moore not ceased to write, we should
have bidden them look to their laurels.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nonsense,&rsquo; says
Dryden, &lsquo;shall be eloquent in love,&rsquo; and here we find the axiom
aptly illustrated, for in this Eastern Serenade are comprised nonsense and
eloquence in perfection.&nbsp; But, apart from its erotic and poetical
merits, it is a great curiosity, as exhibiting in a very marked manner the
singular changes which the stride of civilisation and the bow-string of the
Sultan Mahmoud have made in the Turkish language and customs within a very
few years.&nbsp; Thus we learn from the writer that a &lsquo;musnud,&rsquo;
which in Byron&rsquo;s day was a sofa, now signifies a nightingale.&nbsp; A
&lsquo;tophaik,&rsquo; which once fired away in Moore&rsquo;s octosyllabics
as a musket, is metamorphosed into a bank of flowers.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Zemzem,&rsquo; the sacred well, now makes shift as a chemise; while
the rallying-cry of &lsquo;Allah-hu&rsquo; closes in a stanza as a military
cloak.&nbsp; Even &lsquo;Gehenna,&rsquo; the place of torment, is mitigated
into a valley, rich in unctuous spices.&nbsp; But the most singular of all
these transmutations of the Turkish vocabulary is that of the word
&lsquo;Effendi,&rsquo; which used to be a respectful epithet applied to a
Christian gentleman, but is now the denomination of a dog.&nbsp; Most of
these changes are certainly highly poetical, and, while we admire their
ingenuity, we do not impugn their correctness.&nbsp; But with all respect
for the author, the Honourable Sinjin Muff, we think that, in one or two
instances, he has sacrificed propriety at the shrine of imagination.&nbsp;
We do not allude to such little incongruities as the waving of a minaret,
or the watching of a mosque.&nbsp; These may be accounted for; but
who&mdash;who, we ask with some earnestness, ever heard of cheroots growing
ready-made among the grass, or of a young lady keeping an appointment in a
scarf trimmed with mutton cutlets?&nbsp; We say nothing to the bold idea of
a dragoman, who snaps Eblis in twain, as a gardener might snap a frosted
carrot; but we will not give up our own interpretation of
&lsquo;kiebaubs,&rsquo; seeing that we dined upon them not two months ago
at the best chop-house in Constantinople.&rdquo;</p>

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
